This neglect is astonishing, since negotiations provide a unique opportunity both to study institutional change in settings characterized by diverging institutional logics and to illustrate how institutional constraints and strategic agency are linked in interaction processes. Based on a combination of the literature on institutional work and the theory of strategic negotiations, we examine in detail three illuminating negotiation processes taking place around International Framework Agreements on global labour standards. This examination reveals three types of (proto-)institutional outcomes produced by these processes: institutional creation, modification and stagnation. Whereas institutional creation and modification, albeit differing in quality, show how integrative negotiation practices of global unions might engage management in a joint endeavor for institutional change, institutional stagnation illuminates some of the pitfalls of negotiation work.},

  Abstract                 = {Complementary to the increasing popularity of social web sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) in the private realm, social software has also drawn the attention of organizations in recent years, leading to increasing adoption rates of enterprise social software platforms (ESSPs) in organizations. Often motivated by employees' changing communication behavior and demands, companies tend to disregard the business motives for social software adoption, namely the benefits the tools provide to the users. To identify such benefits, we collected a rich set of qualitative data aiming at investigating the benefits social software users gain by using ESSPs. Based on the collected data as well as on theory, we propose a conceptual model comprising the potential benefits that ESSP usage brings about and the contextual factors influencing the identified usage-performance relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {With social software's rapid advancement in the private realm, corporations aim to adopt its technologies and to transfer social software benefits, such as enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing, to their organizations. However, enterprise social software platforms (ESSPs) often lack substantial attention. While some research into users' motives to adopt social software in the private realm exists, the body of empirical studies on ESSP adoption is rather limited. Our research objective therefore is to contribute to closing this gap in research by determining the factors influencing employees' ESSP usage. Building on previous research, we present an ESSP adoption model. We then propose an according measurement instrument for empirically assessing the factors influencing ESSP usage. A card sorting and item ranking approach is conducted in order to preliminarily validate the measurement instrument. We eventually suggest methods of classical test theory for the further validation of the measurement instrument and the assessment of the ESSP adoption model.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital natives – the generation for whom the Internet has always existed – have embraced the medium as one of choice. They use social computing applications as a medium for many activities, including receiving and giving product advice (ratings, comments), meeting with and talking to friends (social networking, chat), organizing events (social networking), learning (Wikipedia, weblogs), and communication with the general public (Youtube, weblogs). Facebook, a social networking service, has reached an audience of approximately 800 million users; young Iranians organize protests against their government via social networks, while amateur journalists and artists are viewed by millions on Youtube and weblogs. Inspired by these developments, corporations now seek to adopt social computing applications and derive similar benefits for their organizations. However, despite their growing interest, many firms report significant problems with the implementation and acceptance of social computing applications. In a recent research project we investigated how three companies resolved these issues and improved communication and collaboration by incorporating social computing applications into their intranets. Based on the insights gathered from the cases, a general process for the adoption of social computing applications is proposed. According to our process theory, corporate social computing projects start with a need for better communication and/or collaboration between corporate employees, their business units, or even smaller units (1). When such a need becomes obvious to an employee interested in starting a project, resources required to continue have to be mobilized. These resources may often only be obtained by involving the respective management team (2). Consequently, it is often necessary to inform the management of the needs expressed by the employees by engaging them in workshops or informal meetings in order to carry the idea to the next level. To succeed, the innovator(s) has(have) to use hard data to illustrate the communication and/or collaboration deficiencies. In our cases, surveys and interviews were mostly the instrument of choice. After the innovators had convinced the management of the need to implement social computing, the management also demanded an evaluation of the application by a defined group of people (3). Rather than being defined by their skills and positions, this group of people comprises employees who demonstrate a deep interest in social computing: an interest group. When the interest group succeeds in making a compelling case for the introduction of the social computing application (4), the management delivers the necessary resources and legitimizes the project (5). This legitimation empowers decisions and justifies the costs of the upcoming implementation process. As a next step, the IT department is assigned the task of implementing the system from a technical perspective, including its design, security, and access (6). At the same time, the interest group starts creating content to avoid going live without adequate content to illustrate the purpose of the system. Further, the IT department signals the technical availability (7) and the management gives the final permission to go live, while preparing the announcements that will accompany the rollout (8). Going live is accompanied by a great deal of communication from the project team via the intranet, emails, flyers, and other organization communication channels. In addition, training sessions are organized in which the project team demonstrates the new application by illustrating how the system can be used in the daily work environment (9).

The paper further demonstrates that this mode of labor division is possible only if the periphery is able to acquire and absorb the standards associated with the developers’ activities, described here as a social practice. We describe how the propagation of such standards takes place through non-material artifacts such as code and virtual discussions. We show that because of the capacity of these artifacts to effectively disseminate the standards of a social practice, such standards can be transferred not only face to face, but also asynchronously, asymmetrically and openly.},

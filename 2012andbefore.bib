Economic approaches to governance such as agency theory tend to assume some form of homo-economicus, which depict subordinates as individualistic, opportunistic, and self-serving. Alternatively, sociological and psychological approaches to governance such as stewardship theory depict subordinates as collectivists, pro-organizational, and trustworthy. Through this research, we attempt to reconcile the differences between these assumptions by proposing a model based upon the subordinate's psychological attributes and the organization's situational characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {The Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia: anyone can contribute to its articles simply by clicking on an "edit" button. The open nature of the Wikipedia has been key to its success, but has also created a challenge: how can readers develop an informed opinion on its reliability? We propose a system that computes quantitative values of trust for the text in Wikipedia articles; these trust values provide an indication of text reliability. The system uses as input the revision history of each article, as well as information about the reputation of the contributing authors, as provided by a reputation system. The trust of a word in an article is computed on the basis of the reputation of the original author of the word, as well as the reputation of all authors who edited text near the word. The algorithm computes word trust values that vary smoothly across the text; the trust values can be visualized using varying text-background colors. The algorithm ensures that all changes to an article's text are reflected in the trust values, preventing surreptitious content changes. We have implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to compute and display the trust of the text of thousands of articles of the English Wikipedia. To validate our trust-computation algorithms, we show that text labeled as low-trust has a significantly higher probability of being edited in the future than text labeled as high-trust.},

In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS). The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, KMS research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but rzelated fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of IT in support of these processes.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been claimed that the advent of user-generated content has reshaped the way people approached all sorts of content realization projects, being multimedia (YouTube, DeviantArt, etc.), knowledge (Wikipedia, blogs), to software in general, when based on a more general Open Source model. After many years of research and evidence, several studies have demonstrated that Open Source Software (OSS) portals often contain a large amount of software projects that simply do not evolve, often developed by relatively small communities, and that still struggle to attract a sustained number of contributors. In terms of such content, the "tragedy" appears to be that the user demand for content and the offer of experts contributing content are on curves with different slopes, with the demand growing more quickly. In this paper we argue that, even given the differences in the requested expertise, many projects reliant on user-contributed content and expertise undergo a similar evolution, along a logistic growth: a first slow growth rate is followed by a much faster evolution growth. When a project fails to attract more developers i.e. contributors, the evolution of project's content does not present the "explosive growth" phase, and it will eventually "burnout", and the project appears to be abandoned. Far from being a negative finding, even abandoned project's content provides a valuable resource that could be reused in the future within other projects},

This article focuses on the Wikipedians' (Wikipedia users) personality characteristics, studying Wikipedians' conceptions of Real-Me and BFI dimensions. To survey these aspects, we posted links to two online web questionnaires; one was targeted at Wikipedians and the second to non-Wikipedia users. One hundred and thirty-nine subjects participated in the study, of which 69 were active Wikipedia members. It was found that Wikipedia members locate their real me on the Internet more frequently as compared to non-Wikipedia members. Variance analysis revealed significant differences between Wikipedia members and non-Wikipedia members in agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness, which were lower for the Wikipedia members. An interaction was found between Wikipedia membership and gender: introverted women were more likely to be Wikipedia members as compared with extroverted women. The results of this study are discussed with special emphasis on the understanding of the motivators of Wikipedia members.}

Firms operating in product domains with highly skewed positive returns pay employees more in up-front starting salaries and offer higher compensation growth. The large estimated effects on earnings are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls for worker and firm characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {{One important innovation in information and communication technology developed over the past decade was organizational rather than merely technological. Open source production is remarkable because it converts a private commodity (typically software) into a public good. A number of studies examine the factors motivating contributions to open source production goods, but we argue it is important to understand the causes of high quality contributions to such goods. In this paper, we analyze quality in the open source online encyclopedia Wikipedia. We find that, for users who create an online persona through a registered user name, the quality of contributions increases as the number of contributions increase, consistent with the idea of experts motivated by reputation and committed to the Wikipedia community. Unexpectedly, however, we find the highest quality contributions come from the vast numbers of anonymous "Good Samaritans" who contribute infrequently. Our findings that Good Samaritans as well as committed "Zealots" contribute high quality content to Wikipedia suggest that open source production is remarkable as much for its organizational as its technological innovation that enables vast numbers of anonymous one-time contributors to create high quality, essentially public goods.}},

In this qualitative study I address the potential challenge of these questions by exploring readers and infrequent editors' perceptions of Wikipedia contributors and their motivations. Through analysis of twenty semi-structured interviews, I find evidence of strong negative perceptions as well as positive ones which nonetheless prevent users from identifying with active Wikipedia contributors. I argue that these perceptions present a barrier to the progression of participation over time. I conclude by discussing the practical challenges of my findings for Wikipedia and other online collaborative systems},

In this study we extend prior research on TMSP and Wikipedia by examining in detail the characteristics of the revisions that new contributors make. In particular we focus on new users who maintain a minimum level of sustained activity during their first six months. We use content analysis of individual revisions as well as other quantitative techniques to examine three research questions regarding the effect of early diversification of activity, nature vs. nurture, and associations with later administrative and organizational activity. We present analyses that address each of these questions, and conclude with implications for our understanding of the progression of participation on Wikipedia and other TMSP systems.},

However, the number of contributors is just one way to examine gender differences in contribution. In this paper we take a more fine-grained perspective by examining how much and what types of Wiki-work men and women tend to do. First, we find that the so-called "Gender Gap" in number of editors may not be as wide as prior studies have suggested. Second, although more than 80% of editors in our sample were men, among the bottom 75% of editors by activity-level, we find that men and women made similar numbers of revisions. However, among the most active Wikipedians men tended to make many more revisions than women. Finally, we find that the most active women in our sample tended to make larger revisions than the most active men. We conclude by discussing directions for future research},

The indicator correlates with metrics of governance, political or economic stability about as well as they correlate with each other, and though faster and simpler, it is remarkably stable over time despite constant changes in the underlying disputes.

Second, we explore both direct and indirect effects of these inequalities, exposing the intricate relationships between global inequality, local inequality, coordination, and article quality. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of a Wikipedia articles using structural equation modeling and found that global inequality exerts significant positive impact on article quality, while the effect of local inequality is indirect and is mediated by coordination}

  Abstract                 = {"The success of Wikipedia demonstrates that self-organizing production communities can produce high-quality information-based products. Research on Wikipedia has proceeded largely atheoretically, focusing on (I) the diversity in members' knowledge bases as a determinant of Wikipedia's content quality, (2) the task-related conflicts that occur during the collaborative authoring process, and (3) the different roles members play in Wikipedia. We develop a theoretical model that explains how these three factors interact to determine the quality of Wikipedia articles. The results from the empirical study of 96 Wikipedia articles suggest that (I) diversity should be encouraged, as the creative abrasion that is generated when cognitively diverse members engage in task-related conflict leads to higher-quality articles, (2) task conflict should be managed, as conflict notwithstanding its contribution to creative abrasion can negatively affect group output, and (3) groups should maintain a balance of both administrative- and content-oriented members, as both contribute to the collaborative process.}

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports the results of a qualitative study of motivation and barriers to employee participation in virtual knowledge-sharing communities of practice at Caterpillar Inc., a Fortune 100, multinational corporation. The study indicates that, when employees view knowledge as a public good belonging to the whole organization, knowledge flows easily. However, even when individuals give the highest priority to the interests of the organization and of their community, they tend to shy away from contributing knowledge for a variety of reasons. Specifically, employees hesitate to contribute out of fear of criticism, or of misleading the community members (not being sure that their contributions are important, or completely accurate, or relevant to a specific discussion). To remove the identified barriers, there is a need for developing various types of trust, ranging from the knowledge-based to the institution-based trust. Future research directions and implications for KM practitioners are formulated.}

  Abstract                 = {Nominally free, unrestricted training in portable computer skills is offered by the majority of U.S. temporary help supply (THS) establishments, a practice that is inconsistent with the competitive model of training. This paper asks why temporary help firms provide free general skills training. The answer proposed is that in addition to skills formation, training plays an informational role at THS firms by eliciting private information about worker ability. The model is built on the premise that training is more productive and therefore valuable to high ability workers. Firms offer a package of training and initially lower wages that induces self-selection. Workers of high perceived ability choose training in anticipation of a steeper wage profile while low ability workers are deterred by limited expected gains. Firms profit from their sunk training investment via their short-run informational advantage about ability and thereby limited monopsony power. Market competition among THS firms reduces employer rents, yielding higher wages and more training. Detailed tests of the model using representative establishment data on wages and training find strong support. The analysis demonstrates that beyond providing spot market labor, THS firms gather and sell information about worker quality to clients. The rapid growth of THS as a labor market information broker implies that the demand for worker screening is rising. (JEL D82, J31)}

We begin by examining authentic leadership and its development, followed by work that takes a cognitive science approach. We then examine new-genre leadership theories, complexity leadership, and leadership that is shared, collective, or distributed. We examine the role of relationships through our review of leader member exchange and the emerging work on followership. Finally, we examine work that has been done on substitutes for leadership, servant leadership, spirituality and leadership, cross-cultural leadership, and e-leadership. This structure has the benefit of creating a future focus as well as providing an interesting way to examine the development of the field. Each section ends with an identification of issues to be addressed in the future, in addition to the overall integration of the literature we provide at the end of the article.

Defined as a collective process, creativity involves actors with contradictory IPR needs. This leads to an "IPR dilemna". Firms are looking into appropriating creative work and prevent imitation; whereas creative communities need a weak IPR to combine past work and generate novelty. It becomes problematic for individuals to find themselves between these two. As a result, actors are developing specific IPR arrangements (e.g. open source and creative commons practices) to preserve the balance between appropriation and openness allowing creation. Two creative industries are used as illustrations: music and video-games.}

This survey-based study, conducted with 402 active LUG members representing 191 different LUGs from 23 countries and employing structural equation modeling methodology, supports the proposed model. Furthermore, we find that the Linux user's experience level moderates the extent of the LUG's social influence and its impact on the user's participation.

To do so, it formulates a non- parametric eficiency model that is rooted in the Data Envelopment Analysis literature. In the model, we account for (1) self selection of students and teachers in better schools, and (2) complementary teaching activities. The analysis distinguishes both individual teaching (i.e., a personal teaching style adapted to the individual needs of the student) and collective teaching (i.e., a similar style for all students in a class). Exploiting the data set, we compare the actual teaching style as revealed by the teacher in the data to the model estimations. As such, we anal- yse which students in the class the teacher is targeting with his/her teaching style. The main results show that high test scores are associated with teaching styles that emphasise problem solving and homework. In addition, teachers seem to adapt their optimal teaching style on the 70 percent least performing students.},

  Abstract                 = {Résumé Centré sur l’intranet de France Télécom, cet article met en évidence deux modalités de productivité contrastées dans ses usages socio-organisationnels: la créativité et la rationalisation. Les auteurs suivent l’articulation entre ces deux modalités au travers des pratiques de publication/consultation des sites intranets et de la fréquentation des forums de discussion. Ils montrent la synergie et les compromis qui apparaissent entre ces deux modalités et pointent une série de tensions qui marquent les usages et les logiques d’appropriation. Many big firms have developed intranets in association with introducing new ways of organizing work and managing know-how. This study of France Telecom’s intranet brings to light two contrasting types of productivity in the social and organizational uses to which this new technology has been put: creativity and rationalization. The links between these two types are analyzed through the publication/consultation of intranet sites and the frequency of participation in discussion forums. Light is shed on the synergy and compromises between these two types and on a series of tensions that mark the uses and rationales whereby persons adopt intranet.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtual teams and other online groups can find it challenging to establish norms that allow them to effectively balance task and relational aspects of their discussions. Yet, in our reliance on organizational and team theories, small group scholars have overlooked the potential for learning from examples offered by online communities. Theories of deliberation in small groups offer scholars a way to assess such discussion-centered self-governance in online groups. The study operationalizes the conceptual definition of deliberative discussion offered by Gastil and Black (2008) to examine the small group discussions that undergird policy-making processes in a well-established online community, Wikipedia. Content analysis shows that these discussions demonstrated a relatively high level of problem analysis and providing of information, but results were mixed in the group's demonstration of respect, consideration, and mutual comprehension. Network visualizations reveal structural patterns that can be useful in examining equality, influence, and group member roles. The combination of measures has implications for future research in deliberative discussion and virtual teamwork. © The Author(s) 2011.}

These informal groups of people are well suited for the development and sharing of knowledge and practices across divisions. Our investigation of 9 CoPs (created between 1997 and 2002) in 7 major European and US multinational corporations uncovers a 5-phase process of integration and learning activities. Our findings detail a process of member evolution from peripheral, to active, to core members. These five phases – awareness, allocation, accountability, architectural, and advertising – constitute an ongoing process within CoPs, with newcomers joining and some long-standing core members choosing to end their participation.}

  Abstract                 = { The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. }

Supporters of wiki systems assume that the number of authors and their collaborative work lead to good Wikipedia articles. This study tests this hypothesis using methods of empirical research and media studies. It researches the conditions under which a wiki system produces good quality. Therefore a sample of 450 articles from the German Wikipedia has been researched with a content analysis. The study gives answers to the following questions: * What is the critical mass of users and authors in a wiki system? * What effect have number of edits, authors and discussion edits, traffic, age of the article and backlinks on quality? * What influence does vandalism have on quality? * Do anonymous authors contribute in a positive or negative way? * What is the connection between the relevance of a topic and the quality of the article? * Are there quality differences between topic categories? Furthermore the study proposes a way of measuring quality based on the theories of media and communication science.},

  Abstract                 = {Leisure studies scholars have theorised how the Web is changing leisure experiences, and this essay continues that work by discussing the Web and shifting notions of leisure, labour and intellectual property. Much online activity is described under the umbrella term of 'piracy'. By discussing online cultural production in terms of what Pekka Himanen calls the hacker ethic, we can rethink rhetorics of piracy and better understand the positive and negative aspects of online activities. Rather than thinking of online activity as derivative, we can reframe Web texts as doing what all cultural texts do build upon the past. The ethic of the Web is built on a hacker approach to work, play, collaboration, intellectual property. Facebook applications and Wikipedia entries are just two examples of Web users' embrace of the hacker ethic. But is this labour or leisure? Is Wikipedia, a text edited and maintained by volunteers, the result of work or play? Himanen provides a new way to view online activities that sit in between the categories of labour and leisure. Further, the hacker ethic allows us to understand the contested terms of labour and leisure alongside a third contested term: intellectual property. This paper provides a framework to help us better understand the new immaterial aspects of leisure activity happening on the Web. A discussion of these activities in terms of the hacker ethic allows scholars to explore shifting notions of labour, leisure and intellectual property without resorting to rhetorics of piracy.}

In this article, I review thousands of Wikipedia articles about candidates, elections, and officeholders to assess both the accuracy and the thoroughness of Wikipedia's coverage. I find that Wikipedia is almost always accurate when a relevant article exists, but errors of omission are extremely frequent. These errors of omission follow a predictable pattern.

We find that computerization makes a contribution to measured productivity and output growth in the short term (using 1-year differences) that is consistent with normal returns to computer investments. However, the productivity and output contributions associated with computerization are up to 5 times greater over long periods (using 5- to 7-year differences). The results suggest that the observed contribution of computerization is accompanied by relatively large and time-consuming investments in complementary inputs, such as organizational capital, that may be omitted in conventional calculations of productivity. The large long-run contribution of computers and their associated complements that we uncover may partially explain the subsequent investment surge in computers in the late 1990s. }},

Narcissistic personality self-reports were collected from social networking Web page owners. Then their Web pages were coded for both objective and subjective content features. Finally, strangers viewed the Web pages and rated their impression of the owner on agentic traits, communal traits, and narcissism. Narcissism predicted (a) higher levels of social activity in the online community and (b) more self-promoting content in several aspects of the social networking Web pages. Strangers who viewed the Web pages judged more narcissistic Web page owners to be more narcissistic. Finally, mediational analyses revealed several Web page content features that were influential in raters' narcissistic impressions of the owners, including quantity of social interaction, main photo self-promotion, and main photo attractiveness. Implications of the expression of narcissism in social networking communities are discussed.}

  Abstract                 = {{Purpose – Proposes providing an insight about enterprise resource planning (ERP) adoption, highlighting contact points and significant differences between the way small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large companies approach such a task. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a wide literature review, focused on the identification of a taxonomy of business and organizational factors influencing ERP adoption. The deriving research model was incorporated in a questionnaire that was preliminarily tested and finally provided to a sample of 366 companies of any size. Responses were collected through personal interviews made by a dedicated team to a top manager. Findings – The analysis of the empirical data shows that business complexity, as a composed factor, is a weak predictor of ERP adoption, whereas just company size turns out to be a very good one. In other words, companies seem to be disregarding ERP systems as an answer to their business complexity. Unexpectedly, SMEs disregard financial constraints as the main cause for ERP system non-adoption, suggesting structural and organizational reasons as major ones. This pattern is partially different from what was observed in large organizations where the first reason for not adopting an ERP system is organizational. Moreover, the decision process regarding the adoption of ERP systems within SMEs is still more affected by exogenous reasons or "opportunity of the moment" than business-related factors, contrary to large companies that are more interested in managing process integration and data redundancy/inconsistency through ERP implementation. Research limitations/implications – The research model is based on the assumption that business complexity and organizational change are the most relevant variables influencing ERP adoption, and such variables are explained through a set of factors inherently limited by the results of the literature review. Practical implications – The results of the empirical research provide indication to SMEs willing to take into consideration the adoption of an ERP system. The same outcomes could be incorporated into the development strategies of ERP software houses. Originality/value – This paper contributes to enhancing the understanding of the factors influencing the evolution of information systems within SMEs with respect to large companies.}}

The Wikigraph differs from other Web graphs studied in the literature by the fact that there are timestamps associated with each node. The timestamps indicate the creation and update dates of each page, and this allows us to do a detailed analysis of the Wikipedia evolution over time. In the first part of this study we characterize this evolution in terms of users, editions and articles; in the second part, we depict the temporal evolution of several topological properties of the Wikigraph. The insights obtained from the Wikigraphs can be applied to large Web graphs from which the temporal data is usually not available.}},

  Abstract                 = {Although the work of the voluntary sector is growing, the number of people volunteering is not increasing at a comparable rate. This paper argues that the key to an organisation's success in recruiting and retaining its volunteers is to have an understanding of its target group. As a means to developing this understanding the paper reviews the prior research on volunteering and outlines the current situation in the voluntary sector with regard to the donation of time. The review shows that those who volunteer are an extremely diverse group, active in a wide variety of contexts. This makes the definition of a volunteer a more complex task than one would expect. It also demonstrates that individuals and organisations may volunteer for reasons other than purely altruistic motives. Finally, the paper identifies gaps in this area of research and presents topics for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {As in any social organization, people need to invest effort in the health of their online groups. Listservs and other such groups need people to maintain the technology infrastructure, carry out social management tasks, and recruit new members. Members must read and contribute to discussion. Here, we ask why people do this. In many online groups, preexisting social ties and material benefits for contributions are weak or nonexistent. In this chapter, we consider how the formal leadership role, personal and community benefits, and community characteristics influence the effort members put into helping their online groups. Results from a survey of Internet listserv owners and other members suggest that though owners, who have a formal leadership role, do more of the effortful community building work than do regular members, other members also take on some of the work. Moreover, members who value different benefits are likely to contribute to the development on an online community in different ways.}

Here, we study the Wikipedia Request for Adminship (RfA) process within the context of a social network and pinpoint several factors influencing different stages of the voting process. The facets explored are: election participation, decision making in elections, and election outcome. We find that voters tend to participate in elections that their contacts have participated in. Furthermore, there is evidence showing that an individual's decision-making is influenced by his contacts' actions. The properties of voters within the social graph were also studied; results reveal that candidates who gain the support of an influential coalition tend to succeed in elections},

The results of quantitative and qualitative content analyses reveal systematic differences related to the different cultures, histories, and values of Poland and the United States; at the same time, a U.S./English-language advantage is evident throughout. In conclusion, the implications of these findings for the quality and objectivity of Wikipedia as a global repository of knowledge are discussed, and recommendations are advanced for Wikipedia end users and content developers.},

The topological properties of this graph are in close analogy with those of the World Wide Web, despite the very different growth mechanism. In particular, we measure a scale-invariant distribution of the in and out degree and we are able to reproduce these features by means of a simple statistical model. As a major consequence, Wikipedia growth can be described by local rules such as the preferential attachment mechanism, though users, who are responsible of its evolution, can act globally on the network.},

The nature of such projects is that there is little tolerance for ineffective leadership. There are some specific issues and techniques for mitigating the negative effects of more dispersed employees, but these are merely extensions of good leadership—they cannot make up for the lack of it.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing use of information technology (IT) has resulted in a need for evaluating the productivity impacts of IT. The contemporary \{IT\} evaluation approach has focused on return on investment and return on management. \{IT\} investment has impacts on different stages of business operations. For example, in the banking industry, \{IT\} plays a key role in effectively generating (i) funds from the customer in the forms of deposits and then (ii) profits by using deposits as investment funds. Existing approaches based upon data envelopment analysis (DEA) only measure the \{IT\} efficiency or impact on one specific stage when a multi-stage business process is present. A detailed model is needed to characterize the impact of \{IT\} on each stage of the business operation. The current paper develops a \{DEA\} non-linear programming model to evaluate the impact of \{IT\} on multiple stages along with information on how to distribute the IT-related resources so that the efficiency is maximized. It is shown that this non-linear program can be treated as a parametric linear program. It is also shown that if there is only one intermediate measure, then the non-linear \{DEA\} model becomes a linear program. Our approach is illustrated with an example taken from previous studies. },

  Abstract                 = {{Socialization of newcomers is critical both for conventional groups. It helps groups perform effectively and the newcomers develop commitment. However, little empirical research has investigated the impact of specific socialization tactics on newcomers' commitment to online groups. We examined WikiProjects, subgroups in Wikipedia organized around working on common topics or tasks. In study 1, we identified the seven socialization tactics used most frequently: invitations to join, welcome messages, requests to work on project-related tasks, offers of assistance, positive feedback on a new member's work, constructive criticism, and personal-related comments. In study 2, we examined their impact on newcomers' commitment to the project. Whereas most newcomers contributed fewer edits over time, the declines were slowed or reversed for those socialized with welcome messages, assistance, and constructive criticism. In contrast, invitations led to steeper declines in edits. These results suggest that different socialization tactics play different roles in socializing new members in online groups compared to offline ones. Copyright 2010 ACM.}}

  Abstract                 = {Virtual communities constitute a building block of the information society. These organizations appear capable to guarantee unique outcomes in voluntary association since they cancel physical distance and ease the process of searching for like–minded individuals. In particular, open source communities, devoted to the collective production of public goods, show efficiency properties far superior to the traditional institutional solutions to the public goods issue (e.g. property rights enforcement and secrecy). This paper employs team and club good theory as well as transaction cost economics to analyse the Wikipedia online community, which is devoted to the creation of a free encyclopaedia. An interpretative framework explains the outstanding success of Wikipedia thanks to a novel solution to the problem of graffiti attacks — the submission of undesirable pieces of information. Indeed, Wiki technology reduces the transaction cost of erasing graffiti and therefore prevents attackers from posting unwanted contributions. The issue of the sporadic intervention of the highest authority in the system is examined, and the relatively more frequent local interaction between users is emphasized. The constellation of different motivations that participants may have is discussed, and the barriers–free recruitment process analysed. A few suggestions, meant to encourage long term sustainability of knowledge assemblages, such as Wikipedia, are provided. Open issues and possible directions for future research are also discussed.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: With the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, user-edited online resources such as Wikipedia are increasingly tapped for information. However, there is little research on the quality of health information found in Wikipedia. OBJECTIVE: To compare the scope, completeness, and accuracy of drug information in Wikipedia with that of a free, online, traditionally edited database (Medscape Drug Reference [MDR]). METHODS: Wikipedia and MDR were assessed on 8 categories of drug information. Questions were constructed and answers were verified with authoritative resources. Wikipedia and MDR were evaluated according to scope (breadth of coverage) and completeness. Accuracy was tracked by factual errors and errors of omission. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the components. Fisher's exact test was used to compare scope and paired Student's t-test was used to compare current results in Wikipedia with entries 90 days prior to the current access. RESULTS: Wikipedia was able to answer significantly fewer drug information questions (40.0%) compared with MDR (82.5%; p < 0.001). Wikipedia performed poorly regarding information on dosing, with a score of 0% versus the MDR score of 90.0%. Answers found in Wikipedia were 76.0% complete, while MDR provided answers that were 95.5% complete; overall, Wikipedia answers were less complete than those in Medscape (p < 0.001). No factual errors were found in Wikipedia, whereas 4 answers in Medscape conflicted with the answer key; errors of omission were higher in Wikipedia (n = 48) than in MDR (n = 14). There was a marked improvement in Wikipedia over time, as current entries were superior to those 90 days prior (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Wikipedia has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission than the comparator database. Wikipedia may be a useful point of engagement for consumers, but is not authoritative and should only be a supplemental source of drug information.}

  Abstract                 = {A recent survey of contributors to Wikipedia found that less than 15% of contributors are women. This gender contribution gap has received significant attention from both researchers and the media. A panel of researchers and practitioners has offered several insights and opinions as to why a gender gap exists in contributions despite gender anonymity online. The gender research literature suggests that the difference in contribution rates could be due to three factors: (1) the high levels of conflict in discussions, (2) dislike of critical environments, and (3) lack of confidence in editing other contributors' work. This paper examines these hypotheses regarding the existence of the gender gap in contribution by using data from an international survey of 176,192 readers, contributors, and former contributors to Wikipedia, including measures of demographics, education, motivation, and participation. Implications for improving the design and culture of online communities to be more gender inclusive are discussed},

Here we consider two of the most fun- damental definitions of influence, one based on a small set of "snapshot" observations of a social network and the other based on detailed temporal dynamics. The former is partic- ularly useful because large-scale social network data sets are often available only in snapshots or crawls. The latter how- ever provides a more detailed process model of how influence spreads. We study the relationship between these two ways of measuring influence, in particular establishing how to in- fer the more detailed temporal measure from the more readily observable snapshot measure. We validate our analysis using the history of social interactions on Wikipedia; the result is the first large-scale study to exhibit a direct relationship be- tween snapshot and temporal models of social influence.

We are particularly interested in self-managing virtual teams because self-management seems to be a common phenomenon in teams that interact primarily through information technology (so-called virtual teams). Building on leadership theory and structuration theory, the theory describes leadership as a process that results in the reinforcement, creation and evolution of ongoing structures and distinguishes between two types of leadership. We identify first-order leadership as leadership that works within and reinforces existing structures to elicit and guide group contributions. We define second-order leadership as behavior that effects changes in the structure that guides group action. We argue that second-order leadership is enabled by first-order leadership, is therefore action embedded, and is grounded in processes that define the social identity of the team. We propose that effective self-managing virtual teams will exhibit a paradoxical combination of shared, distributed first-order leadership complemented by strong, concentrated, and centralized second-order leadership. We conclude by presenting a set of research questions and suggestions for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development teams provide an interesting and convenient setting for studying distributed work. We begin by answering perhaps the most basic question: what is the social structure of these teams? Based on a social network analysis of interactions represented in 62,110 bug reports from 122 large and active projects, we find that some OSS teams are highly centralized, but contrary to expectation, others are not. Projects are mostly quite hierarchical on four measures of hierarchy, consistent with past research but contrary to the popular image of these projects. Furthermore, we find that the level of centralization is negatively correlated with project size, suggesting that larger projects become more modular. The paper makes a further methodological contribution by identifying appropriate analysis approaches for interaction data. We conclude by sketching directions for future research.},

But what do we really know about the communication patterns of FLOSS projects? How generalizable are the projects that have been studied? Is there consistency across FLOSS projects? Questioning the assumption of distinctiveness is important because practitioner{\textendash}advocates from within the FLOSS community rely on features of social structure to describe and account for some of the advantages of FLOSS production. To address this question, we examined 120 project teams from SourceForge, representing a wide range of FLOSS project types, for their communications centralization as revealed in the interactions in the bug tracking system. We found that FLOSS development teams vary widely in their communications centralization, from projects completely centered on one developer to projects that are highly decentralized and exhibit a distributed pattern of conversation between developers and active users. We suggest, therefore, that it is wrong to assume that FLOSS projects are distinguished by a particular social structure merely because they are FLOSS. Our findings suggest that FLOSS projects might have to work hard to achieve the expected development advantages which have been assumed to flow from "going open." In addition, the variation in communications structure across projects means that communications centralization is useful for comparisons between FLOSS teams. We found that larger FLOSS teams tend to have more decentralized communication patterns, a finding that suggests interesting avenues for further research examining, for example, the relationship between communications structure and code modularity.},

In this study we address this issue, examining the dynamics that govern the adoption of product and process innovations at the firm level over time. We examine questions such as: Which type of innovation is more readily adopted? Does the adoption of one type of innovation lead or lag the adoption of the other type? And, would the pattern of adoption of innovation types have an effect on organizational performance? Using data on the innovations introduced between 1982 and 1993 by a sample of 101 commercial banks in the United States, we find that: (1) product innovations are adopted at a greater rate and speed than process innovations; (2) a product–process pattern of adoption is more likely than a process–product pattern; (3) the adoption of product innovations is positively associated with the adoption of process innovations; and (4) high-performance banks adopt product and process innovations more evenly than low-performance banks.},

In this context, we first identify the conditions for the two platforms to coexist in the long run. From this baseline, we then consider different strategies for the editor. A first strategy is for the editor to "show the code" of its software, so as to develop more compatible products. A second strategy is to strategically monitor the compatibility degree between the proprietary and OS platform.

Modifications de dernière minute, interruptions, tâches en parallèle, arbitrage entre différents engagements, il est amené à reconfigurer en permanence son activité. Ce travail de dispersion requiert des compétences certaines, et n’est pas sans occasionner des charges supplémentaires tant physiques (fatigue causée par la pression temporelle), que cognitives (interruptions incessantes) ou psychiques (poids des émotions et crainte de l’échec). L’analyse de l’activité dans des agences d’événementiel permet de montrer que le collectif de travail constitue une ressource centrale pour gérer la dispersion et ses effets: la solidarité mécanique qui lie les membres du collectif permet notamment de dépasser dans l’urgence la division fonctionnelle des tâches et de collectiviser la gestion des émotions. The changing forms of planning in organizations place workers in a very labile environment. Last-minute modifications, interruptions, multitasking, balancing one commitment with another… all this leads employees to constantly rearrange activities. This "dispersed work" requires skills and entails an additional workload, both physical (the fatigue owing to time pressures) and mental (cognitive overload associated with recurrent interruptions) or even psychological (emotions, fear of failure). As this analysis of a communications firm and travel agency in France shows, the work group is a key resource for managing this dispersion and its effects. Given the mechanical solidarity between this group's members, it is possible, in an emergency, to move beyond the functional division of labor and "collectivize" the management of emotions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper reports the results of a research project addressing the current state of e-procurement technologies. The results indicate that the final equilibrium may include several technologies, each one serving a different segment of the market. This multiplicity of solutions is likely to further delay the transition of the industry to its growth stage. Companies are approaching e-procurement technologies with very different strategies. We identify two main types of companies. The first type is moving aggressively to adopt e-procurement technologies, frequently experimenting with various solutions. The second type adopts a more conservative strategy by selectively experimenting, typically with one technology. This latter group relies on these limited experiences to provide the capabilities to move quickly into the technology as a dominant design emerges. The results suggest that e-procurement technologies will become an important part of supply chain management and that the rate of adoption will accelerate as aggressive adopters share their experiences conclusion: E-Procurement technologies have been the subject of much discussion and great expectation. The market has been disappointed with what e-procurement models have delivered to date. Nevertheless, in most cases, these technologies present attractive value propositions for greater organizational efficiency and reduced costs and cycle times. Nothing in our analysis indicates that the apparently inexorable shift in business communications toward the Internet is grinding to a halt. However, the report does provide evidence that organizational participation, investment, and use of e-procurement technologies is occurring at a slower pace than the market expected. E-Procurement technology and its applications are still in their infancy and going through growing pains not uncommon to new technologies and changing initiatives. Aggressive adopters are moving steadily into these technologies and the future outlook indicates that their importance will grow as companies move from experimenting to fully adopting e-procurement technologies. The quantifiable savings as well as the qualitative benefits associated with these technologies indicate that the rate of adoption will accelerate as aggressive adopters share their positive experiences regarding perceived technology and business risks. The overall respondent perception is that e-procurement technologies will become an important element in the management of supply chains. Except for a small group of companies that have chosen to sit on the side and let others experiment, organizations are actively involved in these technologies. Most organizations are participating with small investments that allow them to be aware of developments and develop the required capabilities to move into these technologies. These experiments with e-procurement technologies are run on non-core supply processes such as office supplies and computers. A selected group, however, is investing heavily in e-procurement technologies with the expectation of deriving the promised benefits ahead of their competitors. These aggressive adopters are companies that enjoy a better competitive position. The economically determined selection process at this early stage suggests that the outcome may not be a single dominant design but a set of technological solutions that vary across market segments. Thus, companies planning to move their core supply processes to an e-procurement solution should carefully weigh the economics of the various e-procurement technologies. A scaled-down version of the best solution for a large organization may not be the best technology for a smaller company. E-Procurement technologies are still perceived to involve significant risks. From a technology point of view, the lack of an overall accepted standard is holding back a sizeable number of companies from adopting technologies. These companies fear buying into a ‘closed’ technology that cannot communicate with other technologies and thus limits access to a broader network of supply chain constituencies. But the risks are not limited to technology, they also involve the business model that will emerge to support e-procurement technologies. These technologies will redefine the supplier – customer relationship — who can be a supplier? who pays for the investment required to access the technology? what information gets shared? The success of some e-procurement technologies relies on network effects that appear only if enough players adopt these technologies. Finally, there are risks that bridge business and technology, including security and control systems that will ensure the reliability of e-procurement technologies. The good news is that companies that have aggressively moved into these technologies perceive these risks to be lower than companies that have adopted a ‘wait and see’ approach. If this lower risk perception is related to their experience with e-procurement technologies, the cost that slower adopters perceive may be over-estimated and will come down as aggressive adopters share their experiences. In summary, the results of the survey provide a comprehensive picture of the current state of e-procurement technologies. The results should be assessed in light of the fast-paced technological changes in the marketplace and the volatile history and hype that have recently accompanied emerging Internet-based business applications such as e-procurement.}},

  Abstract                 = {For many years, there has been considerable debate about whether the IT revolution was paying off in higher productivity. Studies in the 1980s found no connection between IT investment and productivity in the U.S. economy, a situation referred to as the productivity paradox. Since then, a decade of studies at the firm and country level has consistently shown that the impact of IT investment on labor productivity and economic growth is significant and positive. This article critically reviews the published research, more than 50 articles, on computers and productivity. It develops a general framework for classifying the research, which facilitates identifying what we know, how well we know it, and what we do not know. The framework enables us to systematically organize, synthesize, and evaluate the empirical evidence and to identify both limitations in existing research and data and substantive areas for future research.The review concludes that the productivity paradox as first formulated has been effectively refuted. At both the firm and the country level, greater investment in IT is associated with greater productivity growth. At the firm level, the review further concludes that the wide range of performance of IT investments among different organizations can be explained by complementary investments in organizational capital such as decentralized decision-making systems, job training, and business process redesign. IT is not simply a tool for automating existing processes, but is more importantly an enabler of organizational changes that can lead to additional productivity gains.In mid-2000, IT capital investment began to fall sharply due to slowing economic growth, the collapse of many Internet-related firms, and reductions in IT spending by other firms facing fewer competitive pressures from Internet firms. This reduction in IT investment has had devastating effects on the IT-producing sector, and may lead to slower economic and productivity growth in the U.S. economy. While the turmoil in the technology sector has been unsettling to investors and executives alike, this review shows that it should not overshadow the fundamental changes that have occurred as a result of firms' investments in IT. Notwithstanding the demise of many Internet-related companies, the returns to IT investment are real, and innovative companies continue to lead the way.},

Some researchers portray open source as an extension of the earlier open systems movement (West and Dedrick, 2001). While there has been some research on open-systems software adoption by corporate MIS organizations (Chau and Tam, 1997) the issue of open source adoption has received little attention. We use a series of interviews with MIS managers to develop a grounded theory of open source platform adoption. We contrast this to prior academic and popular reports about the adoption of open source.},

In particular, metadata in the form of "templates" added to pages have come to play a critical role, working in a sense like stigmergic "stigmata" or "signals" which editors use to orient the efforts of their colleagues. We wonder whether such signals can be used to actually coordinate more effectively the collective efforts of editors. Based on an empirical analysis of two types of signals in Wikipedia, namely the "unsimple" and "NPOV" templates, we provide mixed evidence to support this claim. The effectiveness of stigmergic metadata signals appears to be affected by the division of labor within the Wikipedia community between core and more peripheral members.}}

The extent and the nature of this divide depend on the kind of access defined. Considering the possession of hardware, growing divides among different categories of income, employment, education, age, and ethnicity can be proved to have existed in the 1980s and 1990s according to official American and Dutch statistics. If only by effects of saturation, these gaps will more or less close. However, it is shown that differential access of skills and usage is likely to increase. The growth of a usage gap is projected. Multivariate analyses of Dutch official statistics reveal the striking effect of age and gender as compared to education. The usage gap is related to the evolution of the information and network society. Finally, policy perspectives are discussed. }

  Abstract                 = {The Internet is a critically important research site for sociologists testing theories of technology diffusion and media effects, particularly because it is a medium uniquely capable of integrating modes of communication and forms of content. Current research tends to focus on the Internet’s implications in five domains: 1) inequality (the "digital divide"); 2) community and social capital; 3) political participation; 4) organizations and other economic institutions; and 5) cultural participation and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across domains is that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each domain, utopian claims and dystopic warnings based on extrapolations from technical possibilities have given way to more nuanced and circumscribed understandings of how Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits certain innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change. Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications of this new technology depend on economic, legal, and policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need to study the Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize research findings on individual user behavior with macroscopic analyses of institutional and political-economic factors that constrain that behavior.}

Wikipedia is the most extraordinary example of this phenomenon and, although a few mechanisms have been put in place to improve contributions quality, trust in Wikipedia content quality has been seriously questioned. We thought that a deeper understanding of what in general defines high-standard and expertise in domains related to Wikipedia i.e. content quality in a collaborative environment - mapped onto Wikipedia elements would lead to a complete set of mechanisms to sustain trust in Wikipedia context. Our evaluation, conducted on about 8,000 articles representing 65% of the overall Wikipedia editing activity, shows that the new trust evidence that we extracted from Wikipedia allows us to transparently and automatically compute trust values to isolate articles of great or low quality.}

  Abstract                 = {A primary responsibility of university teachers is to guide their students in the process of using only the most accurate research resources in their completion of assignments. Thus, it is not surprising to hear that faculty routinely coach their students to use Wikipedia carefully. Even more pronounced anti-Wikipedia backlashes have developed on some campuses, leading faculty to forbid their students to use the popular on-line compendium of information. Within this context, but directing the spotlight away from students, this pilot study uses survey and content analysis research methods to explore how faculty at U.S. universities and colleges regard Wikipedia's credibility as an information source, as well as how they use Wikipedia in their academic work. The results of the survey reveal that while none of the university faculty who completed it regard Wikipedia as an extremely credible source of information, more than half stated it has moderate to high credibility, and many use it in both their teaching and research. The results of the content analysis component of the study demonstrates that academic researchers from across the disciplines are citing Wikipedia as a source of scholarly information in their peer-reviewed research reports. Although the study's research findings are not generalizable, they are surprising considering the professoriate's oft-stated lack of trust in Wikipedia.}

However, to understand the effects of personality on team performance requires greater specificity in how personality is described and in how team effectiveness is described. A hierarchical model of team member personality is presented that defines higher-level personality traits and specific facets relevant to team performance. Next, a classification of the core teamwork dimensions underlying effective team performance is presented. Finally, predictions are derived linking team member personality facets to specific teamwork requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {Although some have argued that Wikipedia’s open edit policy is one of the primary reasons for its success, it also raises concerns about quality — vandalism, bias, and errors can be problems. Despite these challenges, Wikipedia articles are often (perhaps surprisingly) of high quality, which many attribute to both the dedicatedWikipedia community and "good Samaritan" users. As Wikipedia continues to grow, however, it becomes more difficult for these users to keep up with the increasing number of articles and edits. This motivates the development of tools to assist users in creating and maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose metrics that quantify the quality of contributions to Wikipedia through implicit feedback from the community. We then learn discriminative probabilistic models that predict the quality of a new edit using features of the changes made, the author of the edit, and the article being edited. Through estimating parameters for these models, we also gain an understanding of factors that influence quality. We advocate using edit quality predictions and information gleaned from model analysis not to place restrictions on editing, but to instead alert users to potential quality problems, and to facilitate the development of additional incentives for contributors. We evaluate the edit quality prediction models on the Spanish Wikipedia. Experiments demonstrate that the models perform better when given access to content-based features of the edit, rather than only features of contributing user. This suggests that a user-based solution to the Wikipedia quality problem may not be sufficient.},

It is discovered that theory of epistemic communities does indeed contribute to the understandig of open source software development. But the important learning process of open source development only explained by the introduction of situated learning and legitimate peripheral participation as a theoretical prerspective. This allows the learning process to be part of the activities in the epistemic community. The combination of situated learning and epistemic community is shown to be fruitful and capable of explaining some of the empirical observations. In particular the combination of theories can shed light on the motivational issues and group dynamics.}

We find evidence of peer effects in the pair treatment because the standard deviations of output are smaller within pairs than between pairs. Moreover, average output is higher in the pair treatment: thus, peer effects raise productivity. Finally, low-productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers.}

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia (the "free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit") is having a huge impact on how a great many people gather information about the world. So, it is important for epistemologists and information scientists to ask whether people are likely to acquire knowledge as a result of having access to this information source. In other words, is Wikipedia having good epistemic consequences? After surveying the various concerns that have been raised about the reliability of Wikipedia, this article argues that the epistemic consequences of people using Wikipedia as a source of information are likely to be quite good. According to several empirical studies, the reliability of Wikipedia compares favorably to the reliability of traditional encyclopedias. Furthermore, the reliability of Wikipedia compares even more favorably to the reliability of those information sources that people would be likely to use if Wikipedia did not exist (viz., Web sites that are as freely and easily accessible as Wikipedia). In addition, Wikipedia has a number of other epistemic virtues (e.g., power, speed, and fecundity) that arguably outweigh any deficiency in terms of reliability. Even so, epistemologists and information scientists should certainly be trying to identify changes (or alternatives) to Wikipedia that will bring about even better epistemic consequences. This article suggests that to improve Wikipedia, we need to clarify what our epistemic values are and to better understand why Wikipedia works as well as it does. Somebody who reads Wikipedia is "rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom," says Mr. McHenry, Britannica's former editor. "It may be obviously dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who has used the facilities before him." One wonders whether people like Mr. McHenry would prefer there to be no public lavatories at all.The Economist (Vol. 379, April 22, 2006, pp. 14-15)},

  Abstract                 = {Prior research into open source software (OSS) developer participation has emphasized individuals’ motivations for joining these volunteer communities, but it has failed to explain why people stay or leave in the long run. Building upon Lave and Wenger’s theory of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP), this paper offers a longitudinal investigation of one OSS community in which sustained participation is hypothesized to be associated with the coevolution of two major elements of LPP theory: "situated learning" (the process of acting knowledgeably and purposefully in the world) and "identity construction" (the process of being identified within the community). To test this hypothesis, data were collected from multiple sources, including online public project documents, electronic mail messages, tracker mes- sages, and log files. Results from qualitative analyses revealed that initial conditions to participate did not effectively predict long-term participation, but that situated learning and identity construction behaviors were positively linked to sustained participation. Furthermore, this study reveals that sustained participants distinguished themselves by consistently engaging in situated learning that both made conceptual (advising others) and practical contributions (improving the code). Implications and future research are discussed.

However, firms cite increased retention as a motivation for offering tuition reimbursement programs. This rationale for offering these programs challenges the predictions of the standard human capital model. This paper tests empirically whether participation in tuition reimbursement programs increases employee retention using data from a non-profit institution. To document the prevalence of tuition reimbursement programs, the case study analysis is supplemented with findings from the Survey of Employer-Provided Training, 1995 (SEPT95). This paper finds that participation in tuition reimbursement programs reduces employee turnover.}

Two large-scale surveys with embedded quasi-experiments were conducted: among 11-18-year-olds living at home and among adults 18 years and older. Results showed that although use of Wikipedia is common, many people (particularly adults) do not truly comprehend how Wikipedia operates in terms of information provision, and that while people trust Wikipedia as an information source, they express doubt about the appropriateness of doing so. A companion quasi-experiment found that both children and adults assess information to be more credible when it originates or appears to originate from Encyclopædia Britannica. In addition, children rated information from Wikipedia to be less believable when they viewed it on Wikipedia's site than when that same information appeared on either Citizendium's site or on Encyclopædia Britannica's site. Indeed, content originating from Wikipedia was perceived by children as least credible when it was shown on a Wikipedia page, yet the most credible when it was shown on the page of Encyclopædia Britannica. The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.}

Consistent with the norms of an engineering culture, we find that future leaders must first make strong technical contributions. Beyond technical contributions, they must then integrate their communities in order to mobilize volunteers and avoid the ever-present danger of forking and balkanization. This is enabled by two correlated but distinct social positions: social brokerage and boundary spanning between technological areas. An inherent lack of trust associated with brokerage positions can be overcome through physical interaction. Boundary spanners do not suffer this handicap and are much more likely than brokers to advance to leadership. The research separates the influence of human and social capital on promotion, and highlights previously unexamined differences between brokerage- and boundary-spanning positions. Longitudinal analyses of careers within the Internet Engineering Task Force community from 1986–2002 support the arguments}

  Abstract                 = {Wikis have become a popular online collaboration platform. Their open nature can, and indeed does, lead to a large number of editors of their articles, who create a large number of revisions. These editors make various types of edits on an article, from minor ones such as spelling correction and text formatting, to major revisions such as new content introduction, whole article re-structuring, etc. Given the enormous number of revisions, it is difficult to identify the type of contributions made in these revisions through human observation alone. Moreover, different types of edits imply different edit significance. A revision that introduces new content is arguably more significant than a revision making a few spelling corrections. By taking edit types into account, better measurements of edit significance can be produced. This paper proposes a method for categorizing and presenting edits in an intuitive way and with a flexible measure of significance of each individual editor's contributions.},

We then used a quantitative approach to further explore interpretations that arose from the qualitative data. Our analysis of these data together demonstrates how WikiProjects not only help Wikipedians coordinate tasks and produce articles, but also support community members and small groups of editors in important ways such as: providing a place to find collaborators, socialize and network; protecting editors' work; and structuring opportunities to contribute.},

Through in-depth interviews with 20 individuals who have held a variety of responsibilities in the English-language Wikipedia, we obtained rich descriptions of how various forces produce and regulate social structures on the site. Although Wikipedia is sometimes portrayed as lacking oversight, our analysis describes Wikipedia as an organization with highly refined policies, norms, and a technological architecture that supports organizational ideals of consensus building and discussion. We describe how governance on the site is becoming increasingly decentralized as the community grows and how this is predicted by theories of commons-based governance developed in offline contexts. We also briefly examine local governance structures called WikiProjects through the example of WikiProject Military History, one of the oldest and most prolific projects on the site.}

  Abstract                 = {{ Introduction. The question of credibility in participatory information environments, particularly Wikipedia, has been much debated. This paper investigates how editors on Swedish Wikipedia consider credibility when they edit and read Wikipedia articles. Method. The study builds on interviews with 11 editors on Swedish Wikipedia, supported by a document analysis of policies on Swedish Wikipedia. Analysis. The interview transcripts have been coded qualitatively according to the participants' use of Wikipedia and what they take into consideration in making credibility assessments. Results. The participants use Wikipedia for purposes where it is not vital that the information is correct. Their credibility assessments are mainly based on authorship, verifiability, and the editing history of an article. Conclusions. The situations and purposes for which the editors use Wikipedia are similar to other user groups, but they draw on their knowledge as members of the network of practice of wikipedians to make credibility assessments, including knowledge of certain editors and of the MediaWiki architecture. Their assessments have more similarities to those used in traditional media than to assessments springing from the wisdom of crowds.}},

Using trace ethnography, we show how these often-unofficial technologies have fundamentally transformed the nature of editing and administration in Wikipedia. Specifically, we analyze „vandal fighting‟ as an epistemic process of distributed cognition, highlighting the role of non-human actors in enabling a decentralized activity of collective intelligence. In all, this case shows that software programs are used for more than enforcing policies and standards. These tools enable coordinated yet decentralized action, independent of the specific norms currently in force.}

  Abstract                 = {The literature on new technology diffusion is vast, and it spills over many conventional disciplinary boundaries. This paper surveys the literature by focusing on alternative explanations of the dominant stylized fact: that the usage of new technologies over time typically follows an S-curve. The most commonly found model which is used to account for this model is the so-called epidemic model, which builds on the premise that what limits the speed of usage is the lack of information available about the new technology, how to use it and what it does. The leading alternate model is often called the probit model, which follows from the premise that different firms, with different goals and abilities, are likely to want to adopt the new technology at different times. In this model, diffusion occurs as firms of different types gradually adopt it. There are actually many ways to generate an S-curve, and the third class of models which we examine are models of density dependence popularized by population ecologists. In these models, the twin forces of legitimation and competition help to establish new technologies and then ultimately limit their take-up. Finally, we look at models in which the initial choice between different variants of the new technology affect the subsequent diffusion speed of the chosen technology. Such models often rely on information cascades, which drive herd like adoption behaviour when a particular variant is finally selected.},

These online environments allow users to keep up with friends, network with colleagues, and share their personal views and observations with others. Previous work describes typical social networking site users as young, extroverted, and technologically savvy. Little research exists, however, on the emerging role of news in the social network environment. With over 500 million global Facebook users, both print and television based media outlets are making concerted efforts to become part of this important and increasingly ubiquitous virtual world. The present study uses a sample of students, faculty, and staff from a large university to investigate the factors that are related to news use on Facebook. Findings indicate that while news use is still a minor component of overall social network site activity, certain key variables, such as gender and life satisfaction, have a significant impact on how Facebook is used for news-related purposes. Future implications for news in the social networking world are presented and discussed.}},

However, given the many complex and novel issues that surround the use of OSS, the process of OSS adoption is not well-understood. We investigated this issue using a framework derived from innovation adoption theory which was then validated in an organisation which had embarked on a large-scale of adoption of OSS. The framework comprised four macro-factors - external environment, organisational context, technological context and individual factors. We then investigated these factors in a large-scale survey. Overall, the findings suggest a significant penetration of OSS with general deployment in two industry sectors - consultancy/software house and service/communication - and more limited deployment in government/public sector. However, the existence of a coherent and planned IT infrastructure based on proprietary software served to impede adoption of OSS. Finally, individual-relevant factors such as support for the general OSS ideology and committed personal championship of OSS were found to be significant.},

It addresses evidence of normative selfregulation by analysing the discussion pages of a sample of Wikipedia Controversial and Featured articles. It was assumed that attempts by editors to influence one another within these pages will be revealed by their use of rules and norms as well as the illocutionary force of speech acts. The results reveal some unexpected patterns. Despite the Wikipedia community generating a large number of rules, etiquettes and guidelines, explicit invocation of rules and/or use of wider social norms appeared to play a small role in regulating editor behaviour. The emergent pattern of communicative exchange was not well aligned either with these rules or with the characteristics of a coherent community. Nor was it consistent with the behaviour needed to reach agreement on controversial topics. The paper concludes by offering some tentative hypotheses as to why this is so.}

Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. }

The question remains, however: does editing disappear along with the editor? The short answer is ‘no’, when one understands editing generically, as an essential part of the process of creating meaning in a text. In reviewing examples on the internet, one sees that it does not disappear, but shifts from a third-party intermediary to the author and the reader, and from human to more automated types of intervention. However, despite the promise of the ‘semantic web’, these kinds of intervention are unlikely to reach high standards on a consistent basis. The absence of experienced human mediation in the writing process — as in other areas of life — can be harmful to public life, and ways should be found to show the added value that they make.}

Due to the close-to-saturation of ERP adoptions in large enterprises (LEs), ERP vendors now focus more on SMEs. Moreover, because of globalization, partnerships, value networks, and the huge information flow across and within SMEs nowadays, more and more SMEs are adopting ERP systems. Risks of adoption rely on the fact that SMEs have limited resources and specific characteristics that make their case different from LEs. The main focus of this article is to shed the light on the areas that lack sufficient research within the ERP in SMEs domain, suggest future research avenues, as well as, present the current research findings that could aid practitioners, suppliers, and SMEs when embarking on ERP projects.},

There is evidence to suggest that student have been very quick to exploit the opportunities that the Internet can offer them. Students frequently cited search engines such as Google and Web 2.0 information sharing sites such as Wikipedia as the first places they look when seeking information for an assignment. Although a number of disciplines have accepted that Wikipedia can be viewed as an accurate and legitimate evidence source nurse educators tend to view Wikipedia with a degree of suspicion. The purpose of this paper is to carry out an exploratory study of health and health related content on a sample of Wikipedia site with the overall intention of assessing the quality of their source and supporting information. A 10\% sample of health related Wikipedia entries were evaluated, with a total of 2598 references assessed. In total 1473 (56\%) of the references citied on the Wikipedia pages reviewed could be argued to come from clearly identifiable reputable sources. This translates to a mean number of reputable sources of M=29 per Wikipedia entry. The quality of the evidence taken obtained from the 2500 plus references from over 50 Wikipedia pages was of sufficiently sound quality to suggest that, for health related entries, Wikipedia is appropriate for use by nursing students.},

We compared the work of authors who wrote exclusively in one domain with that of authors who contributed to both domains. The position of double-domain authors for a knowledge building wiki community is outstanding. They are not only responsible for the integration of knowledge from a different background, but also for the composition of the single-knowledge domains. Predominantly they write articles which are integrative and central in the context of such domains.},

Two approaches to measuring this coverage are presented. The first maps the distribution of topics on Wikipedia to the distribution of books published. The second compares the distribution of topics in three established, field-specific academic encyclopedias to the articles found in Wikipedia. Unlike the top-down construction of traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia’s topical coverage is driven by the interests of its users, and as a result, the reliability and completeness of Wikipedia is likely to be different depending on the subject-area of the article.},

In this paper, we examine the role that the quality of the contributions, the experience of the contributors and the ownership of the content play in the decisions over which contributions become part of Wikipedia and which ones are rejected by the community. We introduce and justify a versatile metric for automatically measuring the quality of a contribution. We find little evidence that experience helps contributors avoid rejection. In fact, as they gain experience, contributors are even more likely to have their work rejected. We also find strong evidence of ownership behaviors in practice despite the fact that ownership of content is discouraged within Wikipedia}

In this research we analyze 400,000 Wikipedia revisions to understand the effect that reverts had on editors. We seek to understand the extent to which they demotivate users, reducing the workforce of contributors, versus the extent to which they help users improve as encyclopedia editors. Overall we find that reverts are powerfully demotivating, but that their net influence is that more quality work is done in Wikipedia as a result of reverts than is lost by chasing editors away. However, we identify key conditions – most specifically new editors being reverted by much more experienced editors – under which reverts are particularly damaging. We propose that reducing the damage from reverts might be one effective path for Wikipedia to solve the newcomer retention problem.},

High productivity workers tended to join teams first, despite a loss in earnings in many cases, suggesting non-pecuniary benefits associated with teamwork. Finally, more heterogeneous teams were more productive, holding average ability constant, which is consistent with explanations emphasizing mutual team learning and intra-team bargaining.}}

Thus the quality assessment of the content is a pressing concern now. We observe that each article usually goes through a series of editing phases such as building structure, contributing text, discussing text, etc., gradually getting into the final quality state and that the articles of different quality classes exhibit specific edit cycle patterns. We propose a new approach to Assess Quality based on article's Editing History (AQEH) for a specific domain as follows. First, each article's editing history is transformed into a state sequence borrowing Hidden Markov Model(HMM). Second, edit cycle patterns are first extracted for each quality class and then each quality class is further refined into quality corpora by clustering. Now, each quality class is clearly represented by a series of quality corpora and each quality corpus is described by a group of frequently co-occurring edit cycle patterns. Finally, article quality can be determined in probabilistic sense by comparing the article with the quality corpora. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can capture and predict web article's quality accurately and objectively.},

Prior research on CoPs and on the Wikipedia community often lacks cross‐cultural analysis. Despite the fact that over 75\% of Wikipedia is written in languages other than English, research on Wikipedia primarily focuses on the English Wikipedia and tends to overlook the Wikipedias in other languages. This paper first argues that Wikipedia communities can be analyzed and understood as CoPs. Second, norms of behaviors are examined in four Wikipedia languages (English, Hebrew, Japanese, and Malay), and the similarities and differences across these four languages are reported. Specifically, typical behaviors on three types of discussion spaces (Talk, User Talk, and Wikipedia Talk) are identified and examined across languages. Hofstede’s dimensions of cultural diversity as well as the size of the community, and the function of each discussion area provide lenses for understanding the similarities and differences. As such, this paper expands the research on online CoPs through an examination of cultural variations across multiple CoPs, and increases our understanding of Wikipedia communities in various languages.},

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit and a popular example of user-generated content that includes volunteered geographic information (VGI). In this article, we present three main contributions: (1) a spatial data model and collection methods to study VGI in systems that may not explicitly support geographic data; (2) quantitative methods for measuring distance between online authors and articles; and (3) empirically calibrated results from a gravity model of the role of distance in VGI production. To model spatial processes of VGI contributors, we use an invariant exponential gravity model based on article and author proximity. We define a proximity metric called a ‘signature distance’ as a weighted average distance between an article and each of its authors, and we estimate the location of 2.8 million anonymous authors through IP geolocation. Our study collects empirical data directly from 21 language-specific Wikipedia databases, spanning 7 years of contributions (2001–2008) to nearly 1 million geotagged articles. We find empirical evidence that the spatial processes of anonymous contributors fit an exponential distance decay model. Our results are consistent with the prior results on information diffusion as a spatial process, but run counter to theories that a globalized Internet neutralizes distance as a determinant of social behaviors. }

Drawing on a Bakhtinian framework, this article posits a model of dialogic expertise. Specifically, it argues that, by facilitating an ongoing chain of interdependent and multivocal "utterances," Wikipedia challenges traditional "monologic" expertise. Nonetheless, the site's purportedly democratic defiance of knowledge elites (of encyclopedic publishing, academe, etc.) is compromised by the establishment of a "technocratic" hierarchy. Implications extend to the scholarly debate surrounding dialogue and rhetoric and to our understanding of Wikipedia's success in the context of a cultural anxiety-Americans are at once dependent on an extensive system of experts and uneasy about the deferential distribution of power within that system.}

It describes four classes of first-order leadership behaviours (task coordination, substantive task contribution, group maintenance and boundary spanning) and defines second-order leadership as behaviour that influences changes in the structure that guides group action. We argue that second-order leadership is enabled by first-order leadership and is therefore action embedded and grounded in processes that define the social identity of the group. We propose that effective virtual teams will exhibit a paradoxical combination of shared, distributed first-order leadership complemented by strong, concentrated, and centralized second-order leadership. We conclude by suggesting future research that might be conducted to test and further elaborate our theory.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a quantitative study (N=268) of patterns of free revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product development open to the public--an unthinkable idea for traditionally minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced deliberately, the opportunities of open development dominate.}

  Abstract                 = {This paper is a guide to the rapidly growing area of research and activity I call 'new commons.' Simply put, new commons (NC) are various types of shared resources that have recently evolved or have been recognized as commons. They are commons without pre-existing rules or clear institutional arrangements. The paper introduces a map that outlines the NC resource sectors and identifies some of the salient questions that this new area of research raises. In addition, it examines the relationship between new commons and traditional common-pool resources and common property regimes. This overview includes a survey of the physical resources, the user communities, the literature, and some of the major collective action activities. Tacking new commons over several years has demonstrated that this vast arena is inhabited by heterogeneous groups from divergent disciplines, political interests, and geographical regions that are increasingly finding the term 'commons' crucial in addressing issues of social dilemmas, degradation, and sustainability of a wide variety of shared resources. The resource sectors include scientific knowledge, voluntary associations, climate change, community gardens, wikipedias, cultural treasures, plant seeds, and the electromagnetic spectrum. All of these new resource sectors and communities require rigorous study and analysis in order to better grasp the institutional nature of these beasts. This map is designed to serve as an introductory reference guide for future scholarly work. },

Now, Pekka Himanen - together with Linus Torvalds and Manuel Castells - articulates how hackers* represent a new, opposing ethos for the information age. Underlying hackers' technical creations - such as the Internet and the personal computer, which have become symbols of our time - are the hacker values that produced them and that challenge us all. These values promoted passionate and freely rhythmed work; the belief that individuals can create great things by joining forces in imaginative ways; and the need to maintain our existing ethical ideals, such as privacy and equality, in our new, increasingly technologized society."}

An important variable used in the analysis of software projects is the amount of work being contributed, the commit size. Unfortunately, post-facto, the commit size can only be estimated, not measured. This paper presents several algorithms for estimating the commit size. Our performance evaluation shows that simple, straightforward heuristics are superior to the more complex text-analysis-based algorithms. Not only are the heuristics significantly faster to compute, they also deliver more accurate results when estimating commit sizes. Based on this experience, we design and present an algorithm that improves on the heuristics, can be computed equally fast, and is more accurate than any of the prior approaches.

  Abstract                 = {There is a natural match between studies of online communities and social network analysis (SNA). Information Systems research, in particular, has drawn heavily on the growing data sources available that captures the traces of increased online social interaction. However, this type of "trace" data has properties that are distinct from the data upon which researchers in sociology have typically developed social network measures and their interpretations. This paper examines measurement reliability and validity issues deriving from the use of trace data in IS studies of online ommunities, arguing that more attention needs to be paid to the chain of logic linking data collection, construct development, operationalization and measure interpretation. Four issues are elaborated and illustrated from the literature: 1) unexpected reliability concerns, 2) the need to argue and test the link from {\textquoteleft}found data{\textquoteright} to theoretical constructs, 3) validity problems arising from the stability of the constructs over time and 4) counter-intuitive validity issues deriving from the data being near-complete records of communities{\textquoteright} activities. The paper concludes with recommendations for researchers and reviewers designed to increase the rigor and relevance of SNA research in Information Systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduction. Little is known about Wikipedia contributors’ information behaviour and from where and how the information in the encyclopaedia originated. Even though a large number of texts in Wikipedia cite external sources according to the intentions of the verifiability policy, many articles lack references and in many others the references have been added afterwards. Method. This article reports the results of a Web survey of information source use patterns, answered by 108 Wikipedia contributors in spring 2008. Analysis. The qualitative questions were analysed using a close reading and grounded theory approach. The multiple-choice questions were analysed using descriptive statistics and bi-variate correlation analysis. Results. The results indicate that there are several distinct groups of contributors using different information sources. The results also indicate a preference for sources available online. However, in spite of the popularity of online material a significant proportion of the original information is based on printed literature, personal expertise and other non-digital sources of information. The information source use of Wikipedia contributors is also illustrative of the complexity and life-world scope of human information behaviour. Conclusions. Understanding the information source use of contributors helps us to understand how new Wikipedia articles emerge, how edits are motivated, where the information actually comes from and more generally, what kind of information may be expected to be found in Wikipedia. },

  Abstract                 = {Quality models for software products and processes help both to developers and users to better understand their characteristics. In the specific case of libre (free, open source) software, the availability of a mature and reliable development community is an important factor to be considered, since in most cases both the evolvability and future fitness of the product depends on it. Up to now, most of the quality models for communities have been based on the manual examination by experts, which is time-consuming, generally inconsistent and often error-prone. In this paper, we propose a methodology, and some examples of how it works in practice, of how a quality model for development communities can be automated. The quality model used is a part of the QualOSS quality model, while the metrics are those collected by the FLOSSMetrics project.},

  Abstract                 = {Plenty of companies try to access Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) products, but they find a lack of documentation and responsiveness from the libre software community. But not all of the communities have the same capacity to answer questions. Even more, most of these communities are driven by volunteers which in most of the cases work on their spare time. Thus, how active and reliable is a community and how can we measure their risks in terms of quality of the community is a main issue to be resolved. Trying to determine how a community runs and look for their weaknesses is a way to improve themselves and, also, a way to obtain trustworthiness from an enterprise point of view. In order to have a statistical basement, around 1400 FLOSS projects have been studied to create thresholds which will help to determine a project{\textquoteright}s current status compared with this initial set of FLOSS communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia, one of the top ten most visited websites, is commonly viewed as the largest online reference for encyclopedic knowledge. Because of its open editing model -allowing anyone to enter and edit content- Wikipedia's overall quality has often been questioned as a source of reliable information. Lack of study of the open editing model of Wikipedia and its effectiveness has resulted in a new generation of wikis that restrict contributions to registered users only, using their real names. In this paper, we present an empirical study of user contributions to Wikipedia. We statistically analyze contributions by both anonymous and registered users. The results show that submissions of anonymous and registered users in Wikipedia suggest a power law behavior. About 80\% of the revisions are submitted by less than 7\% of the users, most of whom are registered users. To further refine the analyzes, we use the Wiki Trust Model (WTM), a user reputation model developed in our previous work to assign a reputation value to each user. As expected, the results show that registered users contribute higher quality content and therefore are assigned higher reputation values. However, a significant number of anonymous users also contribute high-quality content. We provide further evidence that regardless of a user s' attribution, registered or anonymous, high reputation users are the dominant contributors that actively edit Wikipedia articles in order to remove vandalism or poor quality content.

  Abstract                 = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to further build up the knowledge about reasons for small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt open source enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents and analyses findings in articles about proprietary ERPs and open source ERPs. In addition, a limited investigation of the distribution channel SourceForge for open source is made. Findings – The cost perspective seems to receive a high attention regarding adoption of open source ERPs. This can be questioned and the main conclusion is that costs seem to have a secondary role in adoption or non adoption of open source ERPs. Research limitations/implications – The paper is mainly a conceptual paper written from a literature review. The ambition is to search support for the findings by doing more research in the area. Practical implications – The findings presented are of interest both for developers of proprietary ERPs as well as SMEs since it is shown that there are definitely reasons other than costs involved when deciding on proprietary ERPs or open source ERPs. Originality/value – It can be argued that there is a lack of research conducted and published about why SMEs choose open source ERPs instead of proprietary ERPs. This paper identifies the gap and suggests future research directions about this subject. Keywords Manufacturing resource planning, Small to medium-sized enterprises}

  Abstract                 = {The author surveys current literature on communities of practice and their potential development using networked technology and remote collaboration, specifically with respect to World Wide Web (WWW) communication tools. The vast majority of the current literature in this new research area consists of case studies. Communities of practice have the following components that distinguish them from traditional organizations and learning situations: (1) different levels of expertise that are simultaneously present in the community of practice; (2) fluid peripheral to center movement that symbolizes the progression from being a novice to an expert; and (3) completely authentic tasks and communication. Supporting concepts include aspects of constructivism (i.e., ill-structured problems, facilitation, collaborative learning, and negotiated goals), community knowledge greater than individual knowledge, as well as an environment of safety and trust. Virtual communities are defined as designed communities using current networked technology, whereas communities of practice emerge within the designed community via the ways their participants use the designed community. Current networked technology has both advantages and disadvantages in emergent development of communities of practice. Because most collaboration is text-based, norms are reduced, enabling introverted participants to share their ideas on an equal footing with extroverts. However, the greatest problem with virtual communities is withdrawing, or attrition. This problem can be reduced somewhat through good facilitation techniques and adequate scaffolding, especially in the cases of online communication techniques and technical support. Finally, the author recommends further research questions and proposes a case study, whose purpose is to observe the effects of an emerging community of practice within the designed environment of a virtual community.},

The revisions to each article were coded, and the coding results were combined with a descriptive analysis of two representative articles in order to determine revision patterns. All articles in both groups showed a higher percentage of additions of new material compared to deletions and revisions that rearranged the text. Although the FAC articles had roughly equal numbers of content and surface revisions, the non-FAC articles had fewer surface revisions and were dominated by content revisions. Although the unique features of the Wikipedia environment inhibit strict comparisons between these results and those of earlier revision studies, these results suggest revision in this environment places unique structural demands on writers, possibly leading to unique revision patterns.}

  Abstract                 = {Common ground. Shared interests. Collective goals. Much has been said about the power of technology to bring people together around commonalities to form groups, teams, and communities. Yet, the same technologies can also be used to bring together individuals with fundamentally irreconcilable differences. In these cases, the question is not how to construct systems that build on commonality, but rather how to manage artifacts that by their very nature provide affordances for conflict. In this paper we examine how Biographies of Living Persons (BLP) in Wikipedia exemplify contentious objects, both in terms of their features and their consequences. We draw from discussions of risk management and resilience to outline four approaches that groups can use to manage contentious objects (risk avoidance, risk minimization, threat reduction, and conflict management). Description of the policies, structures, and systems surrounding Biographies of Living Persons in Wikipedia illustrate how application of these approaches enable the creation and existence of large collection of contentions objects, without undermining the viability of the larger socio-technical system.

  Abstract                 = {Social software has recently attracted the attention of organizations. Nowadays organizational social software applications are often bundled within enterprise social software platforms (ESSPs). Given the popularity of social software in the private realm (e.g., Facebook), organizations expect their employees to use the ESSPs in the same frequency right after rollout. However, employees do not always meet this expectation, leading to internal social software platforms that starve for attention. While there is some research investigating users' motives to adopt social software in the private realm, empirical research on social software adoption in an enterprise setting is still scarce. As a step towards closing this research gap, we collected a rich set of qualitative data aiming at investigating the determinants of employees' ESSP usage. Based on theory and the collected qualitative data, this paper proposes a conceptual ESSP adoption model combining the theoretical perspectives of innovation diffusion theory and social capital theory.}

  Abstract                 = {Motivating participants is one of the vital issues for voluntary web communities. Although quite a few studies have portrayed the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a successful example, many of them were focused only on Western language versions such as English. We carried out a survey on Japanese Wikipedia participants and examined their characteristics from a comparative point of view. As a result, we found that the desires to fix errors and fill gaps were the most powerful motivators. In addition, contrary to our initial expectations, many of the participants confessed that they did not feel pleasure from the editing activities. From this, we realized that they are motivated merely by the impulse to remove the incorrect information, and consequently they are ready to leave the community at any point. Moreover, while the wish to share knowledge was the most popular motivation in global studies previously done, few of our participants noted this as their drive. We conclude that familiarization of the community's basic position in society is the essential condition to motivate people continually.}

  Abstract                 = {Information systems (IS) researchers have typically examined the user-system relationship as an isolated dyad between a single, independent user and an individual, freestanding information system. We argue that this conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social network analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes as a function of all of the user-system and interpersonal interactions in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct user-system interactions by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic user-system interactions in a group, and (2) indirect user-system interactions by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approximately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomes—efficiency and quality of care. We find that the centrality of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the user-system interactions is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcome}

Dans un environnement économique et managérial global où le capital social est de plus en plus considéré comme un pré-requis à l’action collective en organisation, l’introduction de ces technologies de réseaux sociaux peut être également une opportunité pour les acteurs de l’organisation de redistribuer le pouvoir et l’influence entre eux. L’objectif de ce travail est de comprendre comment les enjeux de pouvoir liés au développement du capital social impactent l’appropriation d’une technologie SNS. A travers une Recherche Action menée au sein d’une Mairie et en s’appuyant sur la théorie de la pratique de Bourdieu et la théorie de l’acteur stratégique de Crozier et Friedberg, nous identifions que l’appropriation de la technologie de réseaux sociaux est principalement une appropriation socio-politique en deux phases : une phase d’appropriation de la nouvelle dimension donnée au capital social et une phase d’appropriation de la technologie pour servir les intérêts des acteurs concernant le développement du capital social. Ce travail met également en lumière le rôle que peuvent jouer les systèmes d’information et notamment les outils de réseaux sociaux dans le maintien et le développement des positions sociales des acteurs au sein de l’organisation.},

Our paper addresses this gap by establishing a framework for assessing the profitability of customer-centered social media initiatives in organizations. We first outline the importance of customer-centered social media and demonstrate the research gap. We thereafter analyze the common characteristics of customer-centered social media initiatives and identify their main success drivers. We then combine the current knowledge on social media success drivers with the return on investment (ROI) research stream by proposing a balanced framework towards measuring the ROI of customer-centered social media projects. The proposed framework balances a project's high uncertainty with managers' need for hard facts. In a first step towards the framework's validation, we use 12 empirical examples to showcase the proposed framework's application.},

  Abstract                 = {Although Wikipedia has increasingly attracted attention for its in-depth and timely coverage of breaking news stories, the social dynamics of how Wikipedia editors process breaking news items has not been systematically examined. Through a 3-month study of 161 deliberations over whether a news item should appear on Wikipedia's front page, we demonstrate that elite users fulfill a unique gatekeeping role that permits them to leverage their community position to block the promotion of inappropriate items. However, these elite users are unable to promote their supported news items more effectively than other types of editors. These findings suggest that "one-sided gatekeeping" may reflect a crucial stasis in social media where the community has to balance the experience of its elite users while encouraging contributions from non-elite users.}

Although researchers have used broadly similar sets of software project data sets, the results of their analyses and the conclusions they have drawn have differed. The paper highlights methodological differences that have lead to the conflicting results and shows how in many cases the differing results can be reconciled. It discusses the application of econometric concepts such as production frontiers and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to software data sets. It concludes that the assumptions underlying DEA may make it unsuitable for most software datasets but stochastic production frontiers may be relevant. It also raises some statistical issues that suggest testing hypothesis about economies and diseconomies of scale may be much more difficult than has been appreciated. The paper concludes with a plea for agreed standards for research synthesis activities.},

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia’s success is often attributed to involving large numbers of contributors who improve the accuracy, completeness and clarity of articles while reducing bias. However, because of the high coordination needed to collaboratively write an article, increasing the number of contributors is costly. We examined how the number of editors in Wikipedia and the coordination methods they use affect article quality. We distinguish between explicit coordination, in which editors plan the article through communication, and implicit coordination, in which a subset of editors set direction by doing the majority of the work. Adding more editors to an article improved article quality only when they used appropriate coordination techniques and was harmful when they did not. Implicit coordination through concentrating the work was more helpful when many editors contributed, but explicit coordination through communication was not. Both types of coordination improved quality more when an article was in a formative stage. These results demonstrate the critical importance of coordination in effectively harnessing the "wisdom of the crowd" in online production environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Peer production systems rely on users to self-select appropriate tasks and "scratch their personal itch". However, many such systems require significant maintenance work, which also implies the need for collective action, that is, individuals following goals set by the group and performing good citizenship behaviors. How can this paradox be resolved? Here we examine one potential answer: the influence of social identification with the larger group on contributors' behavior. We examine Wikipedia, a highly successful peer production system, and find a significant and growing influence of group structure, with a prevalent example being the WikiProject. Comparison of editors who join projects with those who do not and comparisons of the joiners' behavior before and after they join a project suggest their identification with the group plays an important role in directing them towards group goals and good citizenship behaviors. Upon joining, Wikipedians are more likely to work on project-related content, to shift their contributions towards coordination rather than production work, and to perform maintenance work such as reverting vandalism. These results suggest that group influence can play an important role in maintaining the health of online communities, even when such communities are putatively self-directed peer production systems.

DEA is a general non-parametric method for efficiency comparisons without asking the user to define any relations between different factors or a production function. The method can account for economies or diseconomies of scale, and is able to deal with multi-input, multi-output systems in which the factors have different scales. Using two different data sets, successful and random open source projects, retrieved from SourceForge.net, we analyze impacts on their efficiency from the usage of communication and coordination tools. The results were mixed with no clear positive effects being proven consistently: In the data set of successful projects, mostly negative influences were found. On the contrary, tool adoption showed positive relationships to efficiency in the random data set. This stresses the importance of development status as a moderating variable and might also hint at threshold values for tool benefits. In addition, adoption of tools outside the hosting platform may be more likely for successful projects.},

Founded in 2001, Wikipedia-now among the top-10 most popular sites on the Internet-has succeeded in attracting and organizing millions of volunteers and creating the world's largest encyclopedia. To date, however, little study has been done of Wikipedia's governance. There is substantial confusion about its decision-making structure. The organization's governance has been compared to many decision-making and political systems-from democracy to dictatorship, from bureaucracy to anarchy. It is the purpose of this article to go beyond the earlier simplistic descriptions of Wikipedia's governance in order to advance the study of online governance, and of organizations more generally. As the evidence will show, while Wikipedia's governance shows elements common to many traditional governance models, it appears to be closest to the organizational structure known as adhocracy.}

Data has been gathered from articles belonging to the same topic using a web crawler, in order to evaluate the outcome of the social network measures in the articles. Findings - Finds that the question of the reliability regarding Wikipedia content is a challenging one and as Wikipedia grows, the problem becomes more demanding, especially for topics with controversial views such as politics or history. Practical implications - It is believed that the approach presented here could be used to improve the authoritativeness of content found in Wikipedia and similar sources.

Topic-specific conclusions and recommendations are given throughout the review. There is a solid foundation for concluding that there is an emerging science of team effectiveness and that findings from this research foundation provide several means to improve team effectiveness. In the concluding section, we summarize our primary findings to highlight specific research, application, and policy recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of work groups and teams. }

Managing such diverse views is a persistent problem in cooperative group work. The Wikipedian community has responded with an evolving body of policies that provide shared principles, processes, and strategies for collaboration. We employ a grounded approach to study a sample of active talk pages and examine how policies are employed as contributors work towards consensus. Although policies help build a stronger community, we find that ambiguities in policies give rise to power plays. This lens demonstrates that support for mass collaboration must take into account policy and power.

Some developers are unpaid volunteers who seek to solve their own technical problems, while others create OSS as part of their employment contract. For the past ten years, a substantial amount of academic work has theorized about and empirically examined developer motivations. We review this work and suggest considering motivation in terms of the values of the social practice in which developers participate. Based on the social philosoph y of Alasdair MacIntyre, we construct a theoretical framework that expands our assumptions about individual motivation to include the idea of a long-term, value-informed quest beyond short-term rewards. This "motivation-practice" framework depicts how the social practice and its supporting institutions mediate between individual motivation and outcome. The framework contains three theoretical conjectures that seek to explain how collectively elaborated standards of excellence prompt developers to produce high-quality software, change institutions, and sustain OSS development. From the framework we derive six concrete propositions and suggest a new research agenda on motivation in OSS.

  Abstract                 = {The wide adoption of electronic data interchange (EDI) has been argued to be important for the success of the technology. Past studies on EDI have focused mainly on large firms, as they were the major users at the time. With the advance of technology, however, EDI applications that used to require mainframe computers can be used on PCs at a much lower cost. At a result, small businesses are now able to enjoy the benefits of EDI. Using a technology–organization–environment framework, this study proposes a perception-based small business EDI adoption model that is tested against data collected from 575 small firms in Hong Kong. Six factors are tested using logistic regression and five are found to be significant in distinguishing adopter firms from non-adopter firms. The results suggest the perception-based model using a technology–organization–environment framework is a useful approach for examining factors affecting the adoption decision. For small businesses, while direct benefits are perceived to be higher by adopter firms than by non-adopter firms, indirect benefits are not perceived differently by either adopter firms or non-adopter firms, contrary to the findings in studies on large business. In addition, adopter firms perceive lower financial costs and higher technical competence than non-adopter firms do. Also, adopter firms perceive higher government pressure but lower industry pressure than non-adopter firms do. Implications of the findings and future research areas are discussed.},

The experiment looked at five peripheral cues: (1) presence or absence of an identifiable author, (2) presence or absence of references, (3) presence or absence of a biased sponsor, (4) presence or absence of an award, and (5) whether the article is designated as appearing in Encyclopedia Britannica, Wikipedia, or Encyclopedia of Earth. The results indicate that compared to Encyclopedia Britannica, article information appearing in both Encyclopedia of Earth and Wikipedia is perceived as significantly less credible. They also show that the presence of a biased sponsor has a significant negative effect on perceived credibility.},

Although the entry on atorvastatin did contain sufficient information with a complete list of FDA-approved indications, contraindications, and food and drug interactions, this was not the case for the four other statins examined. Because the entries on the five most commonly prescribed statins lacked important information, the authors recommend that consumers should seek other sources and not rely solely on Wikipedia. Encouraging consumers, students, and health care professionals to evaluate the quality of drug information is an important step in improving health literacy, empowering patients, and ultimately improving health care in our country. While Wikipedia provides some basic drug information, users should be encouraged to supplement that information with traditionally edited sources. Quality drug information is freely available from US government–provided sites such as the National Library of Medicine's Drug Information Portal <http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov> or MedlinePlus: Drugs, Supplements, and Herbal Information <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html> and commercial consumer sites such as WebMD's RxList <http://www.rxlist.com>. Health care professionals—including physicians, pharmacists, and nurses—usually have access through a health care institution to subscription services like Lexi-Comp and Micromedex. If not, several free sources, including Medscape: Pharmacists <http://www.medscape.com/pharmacists/> and DailyMed <http://www.dailymed.nlm.nih.gov>, are available. Patrons will undoubtedly continue to turn to Wikipedia for drug information, just as they do for information on other topics. What is problematic—far more so than with other topics researched in Wikipedia—is the possibility that users fail to recognize its limitations. If librarians encourage users to seek additional information and evaluate the information provided, we will be making an important contribution to health care and our patrons' health.}

During the empirical phase, motivations of the contributors to Wikipedia are identified through analysis of data from two published surveys and a pilot survey conducted at New York University. The underlying values behind these motivations are then defined in the conceptual phase of the study. Finally, a technical investigation is conducted in order to determine how features of the Wiki technology support and facilitate these values.},

This debate is analysed, and arguments of both supporters and opponents (of English, German and French tongue) are extracted from Wikipedian archives. In order to better understand this division of the minds, an analogy is drawn with theories of bureaucracy as developed for real-life organizations. From these it transpires that bureaucratic rules may be perceived as springing from either a control logic or an enabling logic. In Wikipedia, then, both perceptions were at work, depending on the underlying views of participants. Wikipedians either rejected the proposed scheme (because it is antithetical to their conception of Wikipedia as a community) or endorsed it (because it is consonant with their conception of Wikipedia as an organization with clearly defined boundaries). Are other open-content communities susceptible to the same kind of ‘essential contestation’?},

production, the firm is conceptualized as an institution for integrating knowledge. The primary contribution of the paper is in exploring the coordination mechanisms through which firms integrate the specialist knowledge of their members. In contrast to earlier literature, knowledge is viewed as residing within the individual, and the primary role of the organization is knowledge application rather than knowledge creation. The resulting theory has implications for the basis of organizational capability, the principles of organization design (in particular, the analysis of hierarchy and the distribution of decision-making authority), and the determinants of the horizontal and vertical boundaries of the firm. More generally, the knowledge-based approach sheds new light upon current organizational innovations and trends and has far-reaching implications for management practice.

How do such communities handle the problem of trusting that strangers have good intentions and adequate competence? This question is explored in relation to communities in which such trust is a vital issue: peer production of software (FreeBSD and Mozilla in particular) and encyclopaedia entries (Wikipedia in particular). In the context of open-source software, it is argued that trust was inferred from an underlying `hacker ethic', which already existed. The Wikipedian project, by contrast, had to create an appropriate ethic along the way. In the interim, the assumption simply had to be that potential contributors were trustworthy; they were granted `substantial trust'. Subsequently, projects from both communities introduced rules and regulations which partly substituted for the need to perceive contributors as trustworthy. They faced a design choice in the continuum between a high-discretion design (granting a large amount of trust to contributors) and a low-discretion design (leaving only a small amount of trust to contributors). It is found that open-source designs for software and encyclopaedias are likely to converge in the future towards a mid-level of discretion. In such a design the anonymous user is no longer invested with unquestioning trust.},

Researchers at the Palo Alto Research Center in California claim that their ecological model also explains the slowdown in growth that Wikipedia has been experiencing in recent years. They equate limited environmental resources with the finite amount of encyclopedic knowledge and compare conflict among Wikipedia's editing community to resource competition. Time spent by editors on conflicts and coordination activity is increasing at the expense of directly productive work, a phenomenon that could result in gridlock or worthwhile improvements in quality.}

To turn a wiki's revision history into a collaboration network, we propose an algorithm that identifies as authors of a page the users who provided the most of its relevant content, measured in terms of quantity and of acceptance by the community. The scalability of this approach allows us to study the English Wikipedia community as a co-authorship network. We find evidence of the presence of a nucleus of very active contributors, who seem to spread over the whole wiki, and to interact preferentially with inexperienced users. The fundamental role played by this elite is witnessed by the growing centrality of sociometric stars in the network. Isolating the community active around a category, it is possible to study its specific dynamics and most influential authors.},

We assessed whether article quality influenced this ranking. The authors tested whether traffic to Wikipedia coincided with epidemiological trends and news of emerging health concerns, and how it compares to MedlinePlus.Measurements: Cumulative incidence and average position of Wikipedia (R) compared to other Web sites among the first 20 results on general Internet search engines (Google (R), Google UK (R), Yahoo (R), and MSN (R)), and page view statistics for selected Wikipedia articles and MedlinePlus pages.Results: Wikipedia ranked among the first ten results in 71-85% of search engines and keywords tested. Wikipedia Surpassed MedlinePlus and NHS Direct Online (except for queries from the latter on Google UK), and ranked higher with quality articles. Wikipedia ranked highest for rare diseases, although its incidence in several categories decreased. Page views increased parallel to the occurrence of 20 seasonal disorders and news of three emerging health concerns. Wikipedia articles were viewed more often than MedlinePlus Topic (p = 0.001) but for MedlinePlus Encyclopedia pages, the trend was not significant (p = 0.07-0.10).Conclusions: Based on its search engine ranking and page view statistics, the English Wikipedia is a prominent Source of online health information compared to the other online health information providers studied.}

Methods: Wikipedia articles for the 20 most frequently prescribed drugs per published lists of top 200 brand and generic drugs were evaluated. Four drug information residency-trained pharmacists independently assessed the articles for specific categories of information typically found in medication package inserts. Each category was evaluated for presence in the Wikipedia article, accuracy, completeness, and referencing (fully, partially, or none). Package inserts, Micromedex Drugdex Evaluations, Clinical Pharmacology, and Lexi-Comp databases were used to verify accuracy, and completeness was evaluated by comparing article contents to package inserts alone. Results: Of the 20 categories of information assessed, a mean of twelve (range, 8-16) categories were present in each of the 20 Wikipedia articles. Categories most frequently absent were drug interactions and medication use in breastfeeding. No article contained all categories of information. Information on contraindications and precautions, drug absorption, and adverse drug events was most frequently found to be inaccurate; descriptions of off-label indications, contraindications and precautions, drug interactions, adverse drug events, and dosing were most frequently incomplete. Referencing was poor across all articles, with seven of the 20 articles not supported by any references. Conclusion: Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information. Pharmacy faculty should actively recommend against our students' use of Wikipedia for medication information and urge them to consult more credible drug information resources. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.}

The results also demonstrated that CEO-IT distance may have little direct bearing on the outcomes of ERP and BPI initiatives. A closer CEO-IT reporting relationship, however, was found to be associated with higher levels of senior management support for both types of enterprise projects. This empirical evidence reinforced the long-held assumption that organization-level benefits, BPI, and ERP success were closely related; and that these relationships were subject to the influence of the organizational variables.},

Therefore, there is an increased demand for open-source development of enterprise software from SMBs. Many studies have been done on implementation of large scale proprietary enterprise software, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM). However, open-source enterprise software implementation has not received much spotlight yet, in spite of its potentials as a disruptive innovation. In this study, we investigate types of ERP modules developed by an OSS community, SourceForge.net (SF). We classified 447 the most popular ERP projects of SF into 14 categories of proprietary ERP software used in previous studies. When we analysed (by a qualitative method) the contents of each category, we found that SMBs are using OSS for different ERP modules developed and provided by commercial vendors. }

  Abstract                 = {Information systems (IS) implementation is costly and has a relatively low success rate. Since the seventies, IS research has contributed to a better understanding of this process and its outcomes. The early efforts concentrated on the identification of factors that facilitated IS use. This produced a long list of items that proved to be of little practical value. It became obvious that, for practical reasons, the factors had to be grouped into a model in a way that would facilitate analysis of IS use. In 1985, Fred Davis suggested the technology acceptance model (TAM). It examines the mediating role of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in their relation between systems characteristics (external variables) and the probability of system use (an indicator of system success). More recently, Davis proposed a new version of his model: TAM2. It includes subjective norms, and was tested with longitudinal research designs. Overall the two explain about 40% of system's use. Analysis of empirical research using TAM shows that results are not totally consistent or clear. This suggests that significant factors are not included in the models. We conclude that TAM is a useful model, but has to be integrated into a broader one which would include variables related to both human and social change processes, and to the adoption of the innovation model.},

However, there is little information concerning the quality of information found in Wikipedia. Therefore, we created a questionnaire asking for scope, completeness, and accuracy of information found on osteosarcoma. Three independent observers tested the English version of Wikipedia, as well as the patient version and the health professional version of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) website. Answers were verified with authoritative resources and international guidelines. The results of our study demonstrate that the quality of osteosarcomarelated information found in the English Wikipedia is good but inferior to the patient information provided by the NCI. Therefore, non-peer-reviewed commonly used websites offering health information, such as Wikipedia, should include links to more definitive sources, such as those maintained by the NCI and professional international organizations on healthcare treatments. Furthermore, frequent checks should make sure such external links are to the highest quality and to the bestmaintained aggregate sites on a given healthcare topic.

Despite its crucial - though subtle - role in how a number of prominent social media sites function, there has been relatively little investigation of the deliberative aspects of social media governance. Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular deliberative process that is extensive, public, and recorded: the promotion of Wikipedia admins, which is determined by elections that engage committed members of the Wikipedia community. We find that the group decision-making at the heart of this process exhibits several fundamental forms of relative assessment. First we observe that the chance that a voter will support a candidate is strongly dependent on the relationship between characteristics of the voter and the candidate. Second we investigate how both individual voter decisions and overall election outcomes can be based on models that take into account the sequential, public nature of the voting.}},

We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from social psychology. We find that the classical theory of structural balance tends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at odds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe --- particularly related to the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an alternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and provides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one of the first large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using on-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social media sites.}},

  Abstract                 = {This paper aims to review the fiercely discussed question of whether the ranking of Wikipedia articles in search engines is justified by the quality of the articles. After an overview of current research on information quality in Wikipedia, a summary of the extended discussion on the quality of encyclopedic entries in general is given. On this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating Wikipedia entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that scored highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the relevance judgment of jurors. In all search engines tested, Wikipedia results are unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results on the corresponding results position. Relevance judgments often roughly correspond with the results from the heuristic evaluation. Cases in which high relevance judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low score from the heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an indicator of a high degree of trust in Wikipedia. One of the systemic shortcomings of Wikipedia lies in its necessarily incoherent user model. A further tuning of the suggested criteria catalog, for instance, the different weighing of the supplied criteria, could serve as a starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation of Wikipedia articles. Approved methods of quality evaluation of reference works are applied to Wikipedia articles and integrated with the question of search engine evaluation.},

The questionnaire for administrators is divided into three sections: revised scale of participation motivation; daily works and performance; and work styles. The findings of this study include: 1. The major motivations of the administrators to participate in Chinese Wikipedia are: self-growth, sense of mission, and similarity. 2. For work style, in the aspects of working hours and employment type, some of the administrators have atypical work styles. On the other hand, all of them showed a major difference in the following aspects: ratio of full-time student, flexibility of working hours, and employment status and duration. 3. The administrators who have more personal time, weaker social belongings, or longer internet surfing time, tend to have higher motives for being administrators.

Although contributors are all users of the Chinese language, the orthographic, linguistic, regional and political differences among them do exist. Thus, CW has to attend to the different needs of users from four regions of origin (Mainland, Hong Kong/Macau, Taiwan, and Singapore/Malaysia). The paper shows how a technological polity is built, with an aim to accommodate regional diversity, by importing Wikipedia governance principles, implementing user-generated character conversion, and establishing the ldquoAvoid Region-Centric Policyrdquo. It has been observed that although the orthographic and lexical differences have been preserved and respected, the offline political and ideological differences seem to threaten its potential growth, especially when compared to its self-censored copycat Baidu Baike. This paper then suggests it is neither the internal conflicts nor the external competition that matters most to CW, but rather the evolution of its polity.},

The study used a convenient sample that consisted of students who had taken an introductory undergraduate course at a large public university in the Midwestern United States. A total of 134 out of 409 students participated in the study. As information consumers, male students used Wikipedia more frequently than their female counterparts did. With respect to the purposes of Wikipedia use, male students used Wikipedia for entertainment or idle reading more than their female counterparts, while there were no gender differences regarding Wikipedia use for other purposes. Male students were more likely to discount the risks involved when using Wikipedia information compared to their female counterparts. Furthermore, male students had higher ratings than female students regarding most aspects of Wikipedia, including outcome expectations, perceptions about its information quality, belief in the Wikipedia project itself, emotional states while using Wikipedia, confidence in evaluating information quality, and further exploration. Finally, there was no gender difference regarding the number of years of Wikipedia use. However, male students reported having more positive experiences with the information quality of Wikipedia than their female counterparts. Overall, the findings of this study were consistent with those of previous studies concerning gender. Given the acknowledgment of the knowledge value of Wikipedia in recent literature, it seems that there are more advantages to using Wikipedia than there are disadvantages. The current study shows that male students seem to enjoy such benefits more than female students and may have more opportunities to develop their information literacy skills than female students by actively using Wikipedia. This suggests that educators need to encourage female students in particular to explore Wikipedia strategically as an initial information source so that they can develop their information literacy skills for unconventional sources.}},

Out of the Wikipedia articles assessed, only 12 of 22 were found to pass Wikipedia's own featured article criteria, indicating that Wikipedia's process is ineffective.

The achieved performances in terms of the F-measure for featured articles are 0.964 within a single Wikipedia domain and 0.880 in a domain transfer situation.},

These tasks are typically cast into a link-based classification problem, in which the class label of an article or a user is determined from its content-based and link-based features. Prior works have focused primarily on classifying either the editors or the articles (but not both). Yet there are many situations in which the classification can be aided by knowing collectively the class labels of the users and articles (e.g., spammers are more likely to post spam content than non-spammers). This paper presents a novel framework to jointly classify the Wikipedia articles and editors, assuming there are correspondences between their classes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed co-classification algorithm outperforms classifiers that are trained independently to predict the class labels of articles and editors. © 2010 IEEE.}

  Abstract                 = {Given their ease of use and capability for interactivity, new media are seen as having the potential to make visible previously marginalized voices. The online presence of the writing of history is increasing, and this potential would be a welcome development for the field as it would create a much richer set of easily available historical perspectives. However, this article suggests that the achievement of this promise is fraught with difficulty and that a more likely outcome is a mapping of the status quo in historical representation onto the new media. To illustrate this, I present an analysis of the Wikipedia accounts of Singaporean and Philippine history. For Singapore, alternative historical visions are not as developed as those for the Philippines, and this is reflected in the nature of the respective Wikipedia accounts. I suggest that a possible means to achieve something more of the promise of digital media for history is for information professionals to take a keener interest in Wikipedia, with an eye to helping include accounts of documented historical perspectives that are ignored by mainstream historiographical traditions.},

A number of recommendations have been made to sort the chaff from the wheat in Wikipedia, among which is the idea of color-coding article segment edits according to age (Cross, 2006). Using data collected as part of a wider study published in Nature, this article examines the distribution of errors throughout the life of a select group of Wikipedia articles. The survival time of each "error edit" in terms of the edit counts and days was calculated and the hypothesis that surviving material added by older edits is more trustworthy was tested. Surprisingly, we find that roughly 20\% of errors can be attributed to surviving text added by the first edit, which confirmed the existence of a "first-mover" effect (Viegas, Wattenberg, \& Kushal, 2004) whereby material added by early edits are less likely to be removed. We suggest that the sizable number of errors added by early edits is simply a result of more material being added near the beginning of the life of the article. Overall, the results do not provide support for the idea of trusting surviving segments attributed to older edits because such edits tend to add more material and hence contain more errors which do not seem to be offset by greater opportunities for error correction by later edits.},

Not only are many claims not verified through citations, those that are suffer from the choice of references used. Many of these are from only a few US government Websites or news media and few are to academic journal material. Given these results, one response would be to declare Wikipedia unsuitable for serious reference work. But another option emerges when we jettison technological determinism and look at Wikipedia as a product of a wider social context. Key to this context is a world in which information is bottled up as commodities requiring payment for access. Equally important is the problematic assumption that texts are undifferentiated bearers of knowledge. Those involved in instructional programs can draw attention to the social nature of texts to counter these assumptions and by so doing create an awareness for a new generation of Wikipedians and Wikipedia users of the need to evaluate texts (and hence citations) in light of the social context of their production and use},

In a first step, they identified the evidence for their specific question. Afterwards they used their results as reference for the evaluation of the three websites. Using a check list each student and a second researcher independently rated content and presentation of the information offered. All these websites failed to meet relevant criteria, and key information such as the presentation of probabilities of success on patient-relevant outcomes, probabilities of unwanted effects, and unbiased risk communication was missing. On average items related to the objectives of interventions, the natural course of disease and treatment options were only rated as "partially fulfilled." Overall, there were only minor differences between the three providers, except for items related to the specific nature of the web sites such as disclosure of authorship, conflict of interest and support offers. In addition, the Wikipedia information tended to achieve lower comprehensibility. In conclusion, the quality of the healthcare information provided by Wikipedia and two major German statutory health insurances is comparable. They do not meet important criteria of evidence-based patient and consumer information though.}},

First, we shed light on Wikipedia as a phenomenon that has received scant attention from management scholars to date. Second, we show that OSS-related motivational mechanisms partially apply to Wikipedia participants. Third, our exploration of Wikipedia also reveals that its organisational mechanisms are often perceived as bureaucratic by contributors. This finding was unexpected since this type of problem is often associated with for-profit organisations. Such a situation risks attenuating the motivation of contributors and sheds a critical light on the nature of Wikipedia as a role model for open innovation processes.}

The authors empirically validate this framework by analyzing online contributions of lead users for mobile service innovation projects. The findings indicate that the value of their contributions stems from their ability to suggest solutions instead of simply describing problems or stating customer needs. Lead users’ technical expertise also makes them particularly well-suited to develop new functionalities, but less so for design and usability improvements. The digital context favors the creation of explicit knowledge that can be easily integrated into the development of new products. Finally, contributions given by lead users in a proactive way contain more novel insights than reactive contributions such as answers to community members’ questions.

Specifically, we investigate whether, how, and why the productivity of a worker depends on the productivity of coworkers in the same team. Using high-frequency data on worker productivity from a large supermarket chain, we find strong evidence of positive productivity spillovers from the introduction of highly productive personnel into a shift. Worker effort is positively related to the productivity of workers who see him, but not workers who do not see him. Additionally, workers respond more to the presence of coworkers with whom they frequently interact. We conclude that social pressure can partially internalize free-riding externalities that are built into many workplaces. (JEL J24, L81, M54)}}

It is argued that these distinctions are important because they suggest different organisational arrangements for producing such information goods. This method of analysing the nature of the information goods is employed to examine different organisational arrangements using the analogy of collaboration for traditional publication to identify actors and processes. The analysis of 'contributors' is extended from authorship to collectors and researchers. The paper examines a small survey of the governance procedures employed in projects that employ open source methods for collecting various types of information. We noted the prime role of the recruitment process in the relative success of the examples that we examined (ODP, Wikipedia, Nupedia, MathLearning, VRoma, and Web of Life). For these 'collection' efforts, the role of hierarchy in editing and review of project submissions appears to be important than in open source communities and may be an impediment to recruitment and project development. A number of directions for further research are identified.},

The origins and creation of articles; VI. Contents and quality; VII. Decisions and interventions; VIII. Encyclopaedic ambitions. The discussion deals with the approach of this encyclopaedic phenomenon, focusing on its "unfinishedness", its development in different directions, and the social regulation that is implied and involved. Wikipedia is a product of our time, having a powerful vision and engagement, and it should therefore be interpreted and considered on its own terms.},

These new tools, the author contends, may well supplant other communication and knowledge management systems with their superior ability to capture tacit knowledge, best practices and relevant experiences from throughout a company and make them readily available to more users. This article offers a paradigm that highlights the salient characteristics of these new technologies, which the author refers to as SLATES (search, links, authoring, tags, extensions, signals). The resulting organizational communication patterns can lead to highly productive and highly collaborative environments by making both the practices of knowledge work and its outputs more visible. Drawing on case studies and survey data, the article offers managers a set of ground rules for implementing the new technologies. First, it is necessary to create a receptive culture in order to prepare the way for new practices. Second, a common platform must be created to allow for a collaboration infrastructure. Third, an informal rollout of the technologies may be preferred to a more formal procedural change. And fourth, managerial support and leadership is crucial. Even when implanted and implemented well, these new technologies will certainly bring with them new challenges. These tools may well reduce management's ability to exert unilateral control and to express some level of negativity. Whether a company's leaders really want this to happen and will be able to resist the temptation to silence dissent is an open question. Leaders will have to play a delicate role if they want Enterprise 2.0 technologies to succeed.}},

End users are now faced with more challenges as they evaluate how much they may want to rely on information that was generated and updated in this manner.

Les spécificités des CP conduisent à redéfinir la GRH dans un sens plus émergent.

The purpose of this study was to investigate learning in a marginalized community of practice—that of witches. Twenty witches belonging to several different covens, or communities of practice, were interviewed. Data analysis revealed (a) a trajectory of participation representing movement from the periphery to the center of the group; (b) learning in practice that is experiential, that combines formal and intuitive knowledge, and that is spread across the group; and (c) an identifiable process of identity development in becoming a witch. To some extent, the marginality of the community shaped the group's learning and practice.}

For that purpose, we apply Choquet integral-based multiattribute value theory to the elicitation, from rankings of multiattribute hypothetical societies, of individual preferences on different dimensions of living conditions. A simple application of the proposed approach highlights that preferences on multiattribute societies cannot, in general, be represented by an additive value model, as there exist complementarities and redundancies between different dimensions of standards of living. Our elicitation exercise reveals also a strong heterogeneity of individual preferences on hypothetical societies. Finally, we explore how elicited preferences can be used to cast a new light on the ranking of actual societies.}

  Abstract                 = {WHAT DOES it mean to author a piece of writing? For many generations, humans inscribed clay tablets and recorded information on papyrus but only rarely included their own names in the documents they produced. Many of the most famous works of antiquity come to us as accounts of words spoken by someone else. Only after the development of movable type and modern publishing methods did authorship acquire a legal and universal meaning. Copyright laws established the right of the person who penned a work to profit from it and control its publication. By the 20th century, the idea that authors "own" their work dwelled so deep in our cultures that even unpublished authors, even grade-school children recognize and accept the notion without question. Then came the Internet. Initially designed to connect researchers at various campuses and military installations around the country, it rapidly evolved into the now-famous World Wide Web. The technology underlying the web provides some previously unimaginable tools for authoring and disseminating information. Even with movable type, many documents only existed in small quantities. If your local library didn't have a copy and you couldn't afford to buy one, you simply didn't read it. On the web, a single copy of a document becomes available to any person able to connect to the Internet--still not universal access, of course, but the ratio of books to readers has changed by several orders of magnitude.}

However, while Wikipedia is successful at providing access to free, high quality information to users around the globe, the degree to which Wikipedia has succeeded in facilitating contribution on a global scale is less well known. The mechanisms used to determine why and how content is included have, for the most part, taken place "off-stage" and in ways that are less visible to the casual Wikipedia user. In this study, we explore the relationship between the ideals on which Wikipedia was founded and the policies and practices of the close-knit community that has developed around the shared practice of building the encyclopedia. Through a case study of a polarized talk page debate we show that the editorial community of the English language Wikipedia has a distinct cultural character, which can be uncovered through an examination of the way community members use the social and technical mechanisms of the website and through an analysis of the rhetorical appeals made by editors engaged in heated talk page debates. Our analysis reveals an inherent tension among the values held by the majority of Wikipedians, the values articulated in Wikipedia’s mission statement, and the values of the global community of readers that Wikipedia was created to serve.}

We report on the perceived speed and quality of the answers received, as well as what motivates people to respond to questions seen in their friends' status messages.

We select relevant variables and perform experiments to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate promising performance that is better than comparable approaches and could possibly be replicated with other social media applications..

L’auteur remet en cause les thèses proches du déterminisme technique que les nouvelles technologies ont contribué à relancer. Il montre que technologie et organisation se coconstruisent, et fonctionnent dans un rapport de détermination réciproque et souligne que les usages des technologies sont sélectifs parce qu’ils dépendent eux aussi des stratégies d’acteurs et de leurs intérêts sociaux. As part of a social science research tradition that has focused on the relation between techniques and organizations, this empirical analysis of how a firm in the tertiary sector introduced groupware sheds light on the cogency of the games played by actors and on the issues related to power that crystalize around technology. The new technology has revived arguments based on technical determinism, but these are brought under question. For one thing, technology and organization are ‘coconstructed’; they determine each other. There is no simple, one-way impact from technology to organizations. For another, new technology is not ‘automatically’ adopted. Depending on actors’ strategies and social interests, it is put to selective uses.},

Yet Wikipedia over the years has become a complicated bureaucracy that may be difficult for newcomers to navigate. Mentoring is a practice that has been widely used in offline organizations to help new members adjust to their roles. In this paper, we draw insights from the offline mentoring literature to analyze mentoring practices in Wikipedia and how they influence editor behaviors. Our quantitative analysis of the Adopt-a-user program shows mixed success of the program. Communication between adopters and adoptees is correlated with the amount of article editing done by adoptees shortly after adoption. Our qualitative analysis of the communication between adopters and adoptees suggests that several key functions of mentoring are missing or not fulfilled consistently. Most adopters focus on establishing their legitimacy rather than acting proactively to guide, protect, and support the long-term growth of adoptees. We conclude with recommendations of how Wikipedia mentoring programs can evolve to take advantage of offline best practices.},

I argue that the wiki environment provides conditions that help commitments form, strengthen and diffuse, and that this, in turn, helps explain trends of stabilization observed in previous research. The proposed model may prove useful for understanding structurational processes in other large wiki communities, and potentially in other radically open organizations.},

  Abstract                 = {Social aspects are critical in the decision making process for social actors (human beings). Social aspects can be categorized into social interaction, social communities, social groups or any kind of behavior that emerges from interlinking, overlapping or similarities between interests of a society. These social aspects are dynamic and emergent. Therefore, interlinking them in a social structure, based on bipartite affiliation network, may result in isolated graphs. The major reason is that as these correspondences are dynamic and emergent, they should be coupled with more than a single affiliation in order to sustain the interconnections during interest evolutions. In this paper we propose to interlink actors using multiple tripartite graphs rather than a bipartite graph which was the focus of most of the previous social network building techniques. The utmost benefit of using tripartite graphs is that we can have multiple and hierarchical links between social actors. Therefore in this paper we discuss the extraction, plotting and analysis methods of tripartite relations between authors, articles and categories from Wikipedia. Furthermore, we also discuss the advantages of tripartite relationships over bipartite relationships. As a conclusion of this study we argue based on our results that to build useful, robust and dynamic social networks, actors should be interlinked in one or more tripartite networks.

As our data set, we analyze the communication networks associated with 3085 featured articles - the articles of highest quality in the English Wikipedia, comparing it to the networks of 80154 articles of lower quality. As the metric to assess the quality of collaboration, we measure the time of quality promotion from when an article is started until it is promoted to featured article. The study finds that the higher pre-existing social capital of editors working on an article is, the faster the articles they work on reach higher quality status, such as featured articles.

Some have disputed the ability of anonymous amateurs to produce quality information, while others have contested Wikipedia's claim to accuracy and neutrality. Even if these concerns about Wikipedia as an encyclopaedic genre are relevant, they misguidedly focus on human agents only. Wikipedia's advance is not only enabled by its human resources, but is equally defined by the technological tools and managerial dynamics that structure and maintain its content. This article analyses the sociotechnical system "the intricate collaboration between human users and automated content agents" that defines Wikipedia as a knowledge instrument.}

This paper describes a simple assessment of these aspects by examining the outbound links from Wikipedia articles to articles in scientific journals with a comparison against journal statistics from Journal Citation Reports such as impact factors. The results show an increasing use of structured citation markup and good agreement with citation patterns seen in the scientific literature though with a slight tendency to cite articles in high–impact journals such as Nature and Science. These results increase confidence in Wikipedia as a reliable information resource for science in general.},

The survey examined the behavior and attitudes of participants who post (i.e., posters) and those who read but do not post (i.e., lurkers). The results of the analysis indicate that posters and lurkers go online for similar reasons. While lurkers did not publicly ask questions, they wanted answers to questions (62.1% vs. 70.3% for posters). However, lurkers were less enthusiastic about the benefits of community membership, with 41.8% indicating they received less than the expected benefit. In contrast, 36.6% of posters perceived a greater than expected benefit.

This paper examines the costs of two kinds of "crowdsourced" encyclopedic projects: Citizendium, based on the work of credentialled and identified experts, faces a recruitment deficit; in contrast Wikipedia has proved wildly popular, but anti-credentialism and anonymity result in uncertainty, irresponsibility, the development of cliques and the growing importance of pseudo-legal competencies for conflict resolution. Finally the paper reflects on the wider social implications of focusing on what experts are rather than on what they are for.},

Its rapid success has inspired hundreds of scholars from various disciplines to study its content, communication and community dynamics from various perspectives. This article presents a protocol for conducting a systematic mapping (a broad-based literature review) of scholarly research on Wikipedia. The purpose of this review is to analyze particular trends in research and offer the basic groundwork for future studies. We identify what research has been conducted; what research questions have been asked, and which have been answered and which remain unanswered; and what theories and methodologies have been employed to study Wikipedia. This protocol follows the systematic literature review methodology to conduct a systematic mapping study. The review process is work in progress, and has thus far identified over 2,000 studies. This working paper is a rough first draft combining three different working papers by the authors. In its current form, it mainly serves as a placeholder to provide a source for attribution for the website http://wikilit.referata.com, which presents the papers analyzed in the systematic part of this review.

One important motivation that has been identified is the desire for formal recognition in the open source community. We investigated the impact of social capital in participants' social networks on their recognition-based performance; i.e., the formal status they are accorded in the community. We used a sample of 465 active participants in the Wikipedia open content encyclopedia community to investigate the effects of two types of social capital and found that network closure, measured by direct and indirect ties, had a significant positive effect on increasing participants' recognition-based performance. Structural holes had mixed effects on participants' status, but were generally a source of social capital. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is seen by many as a fatal flaw. In this short paper, I will try to show that it is rather a shrewd and fertile design choice. First, I will describe the precise way in which Wikipedia is more decentralized than OSS projects. Secondly, I will explain why Wikipedia's quality control can be and must be decentralized. Thirdly, I will show why it is wise for Wikipedia to welcome anonymous amateurs. Finally, I will argue that concerns about Wikipedia's quality and sustainable success have to be tempered by the fact that, as disruptive innovations tend to do, Wikipedia is in the process of redefining the pertinent dimensions of quality and value for general encyclopedias.

  Abstract                 = {Open source software (OSS) offers businesses significant ways to save money; avoid vendor lock-in; and increase adaptability by opening the market for enterprise systems that support enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM). We refer to such enterprise systems as "enterprise information systems" (EIS). OSS development related to EIS from a leading online community, SourceForge.net, was used to examine how operations management-related modules of enterprise software are being developed. Applications are categorized as either value-adding from the perspective of operations (for example, e-business activity, production planning, distribution/logistics, quality, and materials management, as well as operational activities of CRM and SCM) or support functions (for example, financial, accounting, personnel, maintenance, and research-and-development management). We found OSS development to be more advanced in the support areas of operations rather than in core activities. This is also the case with SCM support to EIS, while there is a balance of support and value-adding projects related to CRM functions.}

  Abstract                 = {Presently, the Wikipedia project lodges the largest collaborative community ever known in the history of mankind. Due to the large number of contributors, along with the amazing popularity level of Wikipedia in the Web, it has soon become a topic of interest for researchers of many academic disciplines. However, in spite of the increasing significance of Wikipedia in scholar publications over the past years, we oftenly find studies concentrating either on very specific aspects of the project, or else, on a specific language version. As a result, there is a need of broadening the scope of previous research works to present a more complete picture of the Wikipedia project, its community of contributors and the evolution of this project over time. This doctoral thesis offers a quantitative analysis of the top ten language editions of Wikipedia, from different perspectives. The main goal has been to trace the evolution in time of key descriptive and organizational parameters of Wikipedia and its community of authors. The analysis is focused on logged authors (those editors who created a personal account to participate in the project). The comparative study encompasses general evolution parameters, a detailed analysis of the inner social structure and stratification of the Wikipedia community of logged authors, a study of the inequality level of contributions (among authors and articles), a demographic study of the Wikipedia community and some basic metrics to analyze the quality of Wikipedia articles and the trustworthiness level of individual authors. This work concludes with the study of the influence of the main findings presented in this thesis for the future sustainability of Wikipedia in the following years. The analysis of the inequality level of contributions over time, and the evolution of additional key features identified in this thesis, reveals an untenable trend towards progressive increase of the effort spent by the most active authors, as time passes by. This trend may eventually cause that these authors will reach their upper limit in the number of revisions they can perform each month, thus starting a decreasing trend in the number of monthly revisions, and an overall recession of the content creation and reviewing process in Wikipedia. As far as we know, this is the first research work implementing a comparative analysis, from an quantitative point of view, of the top ten language editions of Wikipedia, presenting complementary results from different research perspectives. Therefore, we expect that this contribution will help the scientific community to enhance their understanding of the rich, complex and fascinating working mechanisms and behavioral patterns of the Wikipedia project and its community of authors. Likewise, we hope that WikiXRay will facilitate the hard task of developing empirical analyses on any language version of the encyclopaedia, boosting in this way the number of comparative studies like this one in many other scientific disciplines.},

Several researchers have used this information to gain knowledge about the production process of articles, and about activity patterns of authors. In this analysis, we have focused onone of those previous works, by Kittur et al. First, we have followed the same methodology with more recent and comprehensive data. Then, we have extended this methodology to precisely identify which fraction of authors are producing most of the changes in Wikipedia's articles, and how the behaviour of these authors evolves over time. This enabled us not only to validate some of the previous results, but also to find new interesting evidences. We have found that the analysis of sysops is not a good method for estimating different levels of contributions, since it is dependent on the policy for electing them (which changes over time and for each language). Moreover, we have found new activity patterns classifying authors by their contributions during specific periods of time, instead of using their total number of contributions over the whole life of Wikipedia. Finally, we present a tool that automates this extended methodology, implementing a quick and complete quantitative analysis ofevery language edition in Wikipedia.},

However, many of the mechanisms and procedures that it uses are still unknown in detail. For instance, how equal (or unequal) are the contributions to it has been discussed in the last years, with no conclusive results. In this paper, we study exactly that aspect by using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients, very well known instruments to economists. We analyze the trends in the inequality of distributions for the ten biggest language editions of Wikipedia, and their evolution over time. As a result, we have found large differences in the number of contributions by different authors (something also observed in free, open source software development), and a trend to stable patterns of inequality in the long run.}

  Abstract                 = {Open collaborative projects, like FLOSS development projects and open content creation projects (e.g. Wikipedia), heavily depend on contributions from their respective communities to improve. In this context, an important question for both researchers and practitioners is: what is the expected lifetime of contributors in a community? Answering this question, we will be able to characterize these communities as an appropriate model can show whether or not users maintain their interest to contribute, for how long we could expect them to collaborate and, as a result, improve the organization and management of the project. In this paper, we demonstrate that survival analysis, a wellknown statistical methodology in other research areas such as epidemiology, biology or demographic studies, is a useful methodology to undertake a quantitative comparison of the lifetime of contributors in open collaborative initiatives, like the development of FLOSS projects and the Wikipedia, providing insightful answers to this challenging question.

Can these communities scale, controlling their projects as their size continues to grow over time? To answer these questions, we undertake a quantitative analysis of privileged users in FLOSS development projects and in Wikipedia. From our results, we conclude that the inequality level of user contributions in both types of initiatives is remarkably distinct, even though both communities present almost identical patterns regarding the number of distinct contributors per file (in FLOSS projects) or per article (in Wikipedia). As a result, totally open projects like Wikipedia can effectively deal with faster growing rates, while FLOSS projects may be affected by bottlenecks on committers who play critical roles.},

  Abstract                 = {Online community networks can help organizations improve collaboration. However, in spite of their potential value, there has been little empirical research into two important network factors that determine their success: social characteristics of users and changes in operations that result from network evolution. Our research addresses these deficiencies by using a cultural framework. Derived from anthropology, it extends previous system dynamics research on online community networks. The framework acts as a lens, enabling a better understanding of the effects that changes in these factors bring to online community networks. Using data collected from Wikipedia for model calibration, our findings suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, removing policies that focus on building group commitment does not lower performance. The results also show that online networks need structural control, otherwise their attractiveness, credibility and, subsequently, content value might all decrease. To ensure sustainability the network must be monitored, especially during the early stages of its evolution, so that rules and regulations that ensure value and validity can be selectively employed.

  Abstract                 = {Employer-provided benefits are a large and growing share of compensation costs. In this paper, I consider three factors that can affect the value created by employer-sponsored benefits. First, firms have a comparative advantage (for example, due to scale economies or tax treatment) in purchasing relative to employees. This advantage can vary across firms based on size and other differences in cost structure. Second, employees differ in their valuations of benefits and it is costly for workers to match with firms that offer the benefits they value. Finally, some benefits can reduce the marginal cost to an employee of extra working time. I develop a simple model that integrates these factors. I then generate empirical implications of the model and use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to test these implications. I examine access to employer-provided meals, child-care, dental insurance, and health insurance. I also study how benefits are grouped together and differences between benefits packages at for-profit, not-for-profit, and government employers. The empirical analysis provides evidence consistent with all three factors in the model contributing to firms' decisions about which benefits to offer.}

Tout d’abord, les connaissances produites doivent être ouvertes, c’est-à-dire accessibles à tous sans discrimination. En second lieu, les acteurs du processus d’innovation doivent développer une dynamique d’interaction sur le mode « bazar » (Raymond, 1999). L’innovation open source est ainsi différente de l’innovation ouverte théorisée par Chesbrough (2003). Nous discutons également de l’importance de la propriété intellectuelle, et des brevets en particulier, pour sécuriser cette dynamique d’innovation « open source ». Ensuite, nous étudions les contextes propices à l’émergence de l’innovation « open source ».

We claim that this paradigm, which insists on the distributive nature of innovation among a wide range of heterogeneous actors, does not put enough emphasis on the condition of access to knowledge. Yet, the open dimension of knowledge is a very important feature to sustain a collective mode of innovation. We propose therefore a stronger definition of open innovation, which is based on three constitutive characteristics: (i) Firms voluntarily release knowledge; (ii) Knowledge is open, i.e. is available to all interested parties without discrimination; (iii) dynamic interactions take place among the stakeholders to enrich the open knowledge base. Examples that fit our definition of open innovation are open science, user centered innovation (von Hippel, 2005), free-libre open source software, collective invention (Allen, 1983), etc. We conclude with a discussion on the role of IPR to secure open innovation.

We use the case of recent changes in the structure of Quebec's health care organizations and a change in the commercial policies of a key vendor to illustrate our conclusions regarding barriers to adoption of open source products.}},

Instances of PDRs include the repository of reviews at Amazon.com and the online encyclopedia at Wikipedia. These repositories are created and sustained by the voluntary contributions of individuals who are not compensated for their inputs. This paper draws on and extends Critical Mass theory in the context of PDRs. Using data on the reviews written by prolific reviewers at Amazon.com and the text of their personal profiles, we find that the critical mass of contributors at the PDR not only to be prolific and contributing high-quality reviews, but also to be among the earliest contributors of reviews on products. Reviewer profiles revealed the presence of multiple self-oriented motives (self expression, personal development, utilitarian motives and enjoyment) and other-oriented motives (social affiliation, altruism and reciprocity) for contribution. We find that the quality and the quantity of contributions by the critical mass are negatively related and the motives for contribution of quantity are different from those related to the quality of contribution. The study highlights that PDRs are viewed by contributors as social contexts even though making contributions is an individual act that does not involve social interaction.}

After presenting the core elements and basic characteristics of wikis and Wikipedia respectively, the article discusses four related issues of social memory studies: collective memory, communicative and cultural memory, 'memory places' and the 'floating gap'. In a third step, these theoretical premises are connected to the understanding of discourse as social cognition. Fourth, comparison is made between the potential of the World Wide Web as cyberspace for collective remembrance and the obstacles that stand in its way. On this basis, the article argues that Wikipedia presents a global memory place where memorable elements are negotiated. Its complex processes of discussion and article creation are a model of the discursive fabrication of memory. Thus, they can be viewed and analysed as the transition, the 'floating gap' between communicative and collective frames of memory.}

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we examine the discursive situation of Wikipedia. The primary goal is to explore principle ways of analyzing and characterizing the various forms of communicative user interaction using Foucault's discourse theory. First, the communicative situation of Wikipedia is addressed and a list of possible forms of communication is compiled. Second, the current research on the linguistic features of Wikis, especially Wikipedia, is reviewed. Third, some key issues of Foucault's theory are explored: the notion of 'discourse', the discursive formation, and the methods of archaeology and genealogy, respectively. Finally, first steps towards a qualitative discourse analysis of the English Wikipedia are elaborated. The paper argues, that Wikipedia can be understood as a discursive formation that regulates and structures the production of statements. Most of the discursive regularities named by Foucault are established in the collaborative writing processes of Wikipedia, too. Moreover, the editing processes can be described in Foucault's terms as discursive knowledge production. A practical way of dealing with discourses from this Foucauldian perspective is proposed by [22] who outlined the following five steps: 1. recognizing a discourse as a corpus of regularly and systematically organized statements; 2. identifying the rules of production; 3. identifying the rules delimiting the sayable; 4. identifying the rules creating spaces for new statements; 5. identifying the rules ensuring that a practice is material and discursive at the same time (i.e. that the discourse is always connected to the settings and places where it is produced)},

This article, however, reconsiders the usual priority given to digital media by comparing Wikipedia, the free, user led online Encyclopedia, with Diderot and D'Alembert's eighteenth-century Encyclopédie. It begins by suggesting that the dichotomy between information system and text is not sufficient for describing the differences between the two. It then considers more closely the type of critical thinking presupposed by the Encyclopédie. It concludes by raising the question of the role of judgement in making sense of any encyclopedia in a modern world in which knowledge systems only coexist on the condition of being partially blind to one another.}

I argue that digital media introduce a scale of communication—many-to-many—that reshapes how the invention of knowledge occurs. By examining how knowledge production on Wikipedia occurs, I illustrate how many-to-many communication introduces a new model of "participatory expertise." This model of participatory expertise challenges traditional information routines by elevating procedural expertise over subject matter expertise and opening up knowledge production to the many. Additionally, by hosting multiperspectival conversations on Wikipedia, the participatory model of expertise introduces epistemic turbulence into traditionally tranquil encyclopedia culture.

The characteristic patterns of success exhibited in Wikipedia are expected to inform the management of other wiki-based information assets.}

The study seeks to understand the success of the public wiki model, with Wikipedia as the test case, assessing both technology and participant motivations. The study finds that, contrary to the motivation in open source software development, altruism is a prevalent driver for participation, although mixed motives clearly exist. In particular, while participants have both individualistic and collaborative motives, collaborative (altruistic) motives dominate. The success of the collaboration model embedded in Wikipedia thus appears to be related to wiki technology and the "wiki way" (i.e., social norms) of collaboration.}

Some users move beyond such individual efforts to become collaborators, forming tightly connected groups with lively discussions whose outcome might be a Wikipedia article or a carefully edited YouTube video. A small fraction of users becomes leaders, who participate in governance by setting and upholding policies, repairing vandalized materials, or mentoring novices. We analyze these activities and offer the Reader-to-Leader Framework with the goal of helping researchers, designers, and managers understand what motivates technology-mediated social participation. This will enable them to improve interface design and social support for their companies, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.

Despite the SWS focus on collective phenomena – such as crowd sourcing and collective intelligence – previous research on SWS usage in general does not investigate it as a multilevel phenomenon. Our paper addresses this gap by drawing on existing guidelines for multilevel theorizing. We thus propose that SWS usage impacts individual and team performance through its improved collaboration capabilities. Organizational learning and social capital theories serve as the theoretical foundation. Ultimately, we present a multilevel model as the foundation for future empirical research on SWS usage's impact on individual and team performance. Our research's contribution lies in the theoretical derivation of a multilevel model. XXXXXXXXXXXXX Ça a l'air assez théorique tout cela, il semble que ce soit le modèle qu'ils ont appliqué en 2013}

This property, we argue, makes Wikipedia a public good and hence subject to underprovision. A puzzling feature of Wikipedia however is its enormous size, at roughly seven times that of its commercial counterparts. What is driving this growth? And can we rely on this giant encyclopedia arising from free-editing? In this paper, we model contribution to Wikipedia and its reliability. We demonstrate that Wikipedia is indeed subject to free-riding, and offer a novel explanation for the mitigation of underprovision under such circumstances. We also find that free-riding introduces a lower-bound in the quality of Wikipedia. We identify Wikipedia as part of a general Internet phenomenon that we call the Collaborative Net, and that includes features such as citizen journalism. Our results contribute to the existing literature on public-goods, and also have important implications for the much debated topic of credibility in this new Collaborative Net environment characterized by phenomenal growth and information provided by volunteers.}

A widespread view in the corporate finance literature is that executive perks are a form of agency or private benefit and a way for managers to misappropriate some of the surplus the firm generates. According to this view, firms with plenty of free cash flow that operate in industries with limited investment prospects should typically offer perks. The theory also suggests that firms that are subject to more external monitoring should have fewer perks. Overall, the evidence for the private benefits explanation is, at best, mixed. We do, however, find evidence that perks are offered most in situations where they are likely to enhance managerial productivity. This suggests that a view of perks that sees them purely as managerial excess is incorrect.},

Design/methodology/approach – Direct interviews were used to collect data from a random sample of SMEs located in the Northwest of England. Using logistic regression, 102 responses were analysed. Findings – The results reveal that the factors influencing SMEs’ adoption of enterprise systems are different from the factors influencing SMEs’ adoption of other previously studied information systems (IS) innovations. SMEs were found to be more influenced by technological and organisational factors than environmental factors. Moreover, the results indicate that firms with a greater perceived relative advantage, a greater ability to experiment with these systems before adoption, greater top management support, greater organisational readiness and a larger size are predicted to become adopters of enterprise systems. Research limitations/implications – Although this study focused on the factors that influence SMEs’ adoption of a set of enterprise systems (i.e. ERP, CRM, SCM and e-procurement), it fails to differentiate between factors that influence each of these systems. Practical implications – The model can be used to assist software vendors not only to develop marketing strategies that can target potential adopters, but also to develop strategies to increase the adoption of ES among SMEs. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the continuing research in IS innovations adoption/diffusion in the small business context.

These communities are empowered by new information technology-enabled collaborative tools, tools such as blogs, wikis, and social networks. Collaboration on these platforms is characterized by considerable membership turnover, which could have significant effects on collaborative outcomes. We hypothesize that membership retention relates in a curvilinear fashion to effective collaboration: positively up to a threshold and negatively thereafter. The longitudinal history of 2,065 featured articles on Wikipedia offers support for this hypotheses: Contributions from a mixture of new and experienced participants both increases the likelihood that an article will be promoted to featured article status and decreases the risk it will be demoted after having been promoted. These findings imply that, contrary to many of the assumptions in previous research, participant retention does not have a strictly positive effect on emerging collaborative environments. Further analysis of our data provides empirical evidence that knowledge creation and knowledge retention are actually distinct phases of community-based peer production, and that communities may on average experience more turnover than ideal during the knowledge retention phase. }

In this paper, we argue that the value of collaborative user-generated content is a function both of the direct efforts of its contributors and of its embeddedness in the content–contributor network that creates it. An analysis of Wikipedia's WikiProject Medicine reveals a curvilinear relationship between the number of distinct contributors to user-generated content and viewership. A two-mode social network analysis demonstrates that the embeddedness of the content in the content–contributor network is positively related to viewership. Specifically, locally central content—characterized by greater intensity of work by contributors to multiple content sources—is associated with increased viewership. Globally central content—characterized by shorter paths to the other collaborative content in the overall network—also generates greater viewership. However, within these overall effects, there is considerable heterogeneity in how network characteristics relate to viewership. In addition, network effects are stronger for newer collaborative user-generated content. These findings have implications for fostering collaborative user-generated content.},

  Abstract                 = {it is a comment: the field of communication has long been interested in how media is produced and consumed. Ethnographic studies of media are particularly well situated to explore these aspects of media as they reveal in-depth and contextual complexities of media production and consumption processes. Recently, there has been an increase in the ethnographic attention to new media (Coleman, 2010). This growing body of literature seeks to understand and explain the meanings, practices, and institutions of new digital media. Wikipedia is one site for rich media ethnography as a community that is fundamentally reliant on digital technology for its existence. It is into this body of literature that Joseph Reagle's Good Faith Collaboration (2010) is a welcomed addition. In ethnographic fashion, Reagle seeks to understand Wikipedia as the text itself, the community that produces such a text, and the culture that guides the community. Reagle's book explores the collaborative culture of those who produce Wikipedia, which he characterizes as being done in "good faith." To do this, he draws on public activity and discourse, specifically through Wikipedia's content pages, discussion pages, mailing lists, newsletters, and meet-ups. One of the interesting and unique features of Wikipedia is that those who collaborate to create and build the content, known as Wikipedians, also document their decisions, edits, and choices through the text itself. Therefore, the multiple texts of Wikipedia reflect not just the product of Good Faith Collaboration in the community, but also the process of such collaboration as well. Reagle adeptly draws on both kinds of texts to convey an in-depth understanding of the complexities of the new media culture and community. One of the real strengths of Reagle's work is that it is historically informed. Good Faith Collaboration does not get caught up in the newness or revolution of Wikipedia, but instead argues that the quest for universal knowledge that Wikipedia espouses has been a long sought after and enduring notion. Although Reagle traces the idea that increased knowledge and information can contribute to peace and goodwill back to the Enlightenment period, it was the early 20th century where we see the most explicit parallels to Wikipedia's vision to "freely share in the sum of all knowledge" (p. 3). In particular, Reagle suggests that the core principles of internationalism and information science emerged during this time through the works of H. G. Wells and Paul Otlet. Also during this time period, the index card and microfilm emerged as technological ancestors of Wikipedia in part because of their contribution to the collection, categorization, and sharing of knowledge. Of course Reagle also describes earlier digital advancements that were necessary precursors to Wikipedia, including hypertexts and digital networks. One of the main differences between Wikipedia and other open content communities which sought to share encyclopedia knowledge online is the wiki part of Wikipedia. This not only allows for the transparency and mutability of content, but also allows for centralization of the text rather than centralization of expertise. There are no panels of experts to approve what information goes into the encyclopedia, but the wiki allows anyone to contribute to the explicitly and collectively articulated "versioning, formatting, and stylistic presentation" (p. 35) of encyclopedic matter. This technological feature of the site fundamentally differentiates it from other encyclopedic efforts. For many readers of Good Faith Collaboration, one of the fundamental questions about Wikipedia is not only how it works, but why it works. Although the entire book contributes to answering these questions, Chapters 3 and 4, provide the keenest insights into understanding how and why Wikipedia is successful. In particular, these chapters describe the norms that shape the collaborative production of Wikipedia content. According to Reagle, the three core policies that guide Wikipedia are a neutral point of view, no original research, and verifiability. These seem like relatively straightforward policies for any encyclopedia. For Wikipedia, however, the neural point of view is not necessarily merely the product of the collaborative community, but also indicative of the process of the collaboration as well. As editors create, expand, and modify content pages on Wikipedia, they are to represent the various perspectives on a given topic such that their own personal biases cannot be discerned. Necessary to enacting a neutral point of view in a collaborative community is presuming good faith. This involves four virtues: assuming the best of others, patience, civility, and humor. Like other ethnographers, the author looks to tensions in the community through which to identify articulated norms and practices. For example, in describing how civility in particular works, Reagle nicely distinguishes between respecting others and civility, that is, treating others with respect. When disagreements arise on Wikipedia, as they do in any community, the latter is far more important to uphold. As the title indicates, good faith is the key value which shapes the practices, norms, and discourse of collaborative producers of Wikipedia. The author also nicely problematizes the openness of Wikipedia by revealing some of its boundaries. This technique is a key tool in media ethnography. Characterized as an open content community, Wikipedia collectively produces the software, technology, and content, which are meant to be shared. This openness also involves transparency and integrity, contributing to trust in the community. Openness, however, does not necessarily mean structureless or anything goes. In fact, Reagle illustrates that there are definite boundaries to the idea "anyone can edit" the site. Those who abuse or vandalize the system on it can be and are restricted or even banned from Wikipedia. "Many believe openness furthers the ultimate goal of producing quality content, but a quality encyclopedia should not be sacrificed in the face of a detrimental openness" (p. 87). In other words, Wikipedia works because the community presumes good faith and openness, but will act either collectively or under the leadership of Jimmy Wales to uphold the integrity of the encyclopedia when threatened by vandals not acting with civility and good faith. Even when members are acting in good faith, certain challenges can develop within the collaborative community, particularly regarding consensus and leadership. The larger the community becomes, the more likely structures for managing the community will emerge. Reagle explores the tensions and boundaries of how consensus and leadership work within the open collaborative community of Wikipedia. Overall, consensus on Wikipedia is not a product of collaboration, but part of the process of collaboration. Consensus is not unanimity among Wikipedians, but "overwhelming agreement" (p. 100). Deliberation and openness are highly valued in the community and integral to consensus. All opinions including those of the minority are actively encouraged to be expressed so that the community may learn from them. Nevertheless, tensions among members arise when factions form or when disagreement about when rough consensus is reached. It is sometimes in these moments where leadership structures or persons have stepped in. Despite structures emerging within the community to manage its growth, the community has gone to great efforts to remain nonhierarchical, deliberative, and transparent. All media ethnographies have particular boundaries and scopes, and it is methodologically important to describe these boundaries so that readers can evaluate the transferability of the scholarship (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Fundamentally, Good Faith Collaboration is about the production of Wikipedia, not its consumption, so readers interested in the audience's perspective will need to look elsewhere. It is likely, of course, that those members of the Wikipedia collaborative community are avid consumers of Wikipedia as well; however, those who self-identify as Wikipedians do not include people who read and consume Wikipedia, but do not collaborate or contribute to its production. One could argue that the success of Wikipedia is in some part due to the millions of people who visit and read the site, but many never edit an entry nor ever see the discussion or policy pages of the site. In the second to last chapter of the book, Reagle provides a brief, but intriguing glimpse into how Wikipedia is consumed by those who do not consider themselves Wikipedians. He quotes Nicolas Carr who critiques Wikipedia, but acknowledges that he "regularly consult[s] it to get a quick gloss on a subject." The idea that a critic of Wikipedia still regularly consults the source in today's vast information environment is an interesting phenomenon and worthy of further ethnographic exploration. These users, although not part of the community of Wikipedians, are nonetheless contributors to the success of Wikipedia. Although Good Faith Collaboration includes critical perspectives of those like Carr, who are neither advocates, nor members of the Wikipedian community, the book does not explicate the practices of reading and consuming Wikipedia in everyday life. Nevertheless, Reagle provides ample data regarding the everyday practices and cultural norms of the community which collaborates to produce Wikipedia. His rich research and nuanced appreciation of the complexities of cultural digital media research are well presented. Stylistically, the book was a pleasure to read. Good Faith Collaboration is an important contribution to understanding the collaborative culture of media production and the open content community. The production processes and practices of Wikipedia represent a fascinating tale in media ethnography. },

While Internet Social Networking (ISN) as a public phenomenon has drawn considerable interest from the academic community, little knowledge exists about the potentials and modes of use of social networking sites (SNS) that emerge within organisations. We draw on three cases of SNS implementation and use in large, knowledge-intensive organisations. A cross-case analysis reveals a set of three modes of use of corporate SNS, which we discuss in light of existing literature on SNS use in the public sphere. More importantly, we reason on the open and flexible nature of these technologies and discuss implications for organisational implementation. Striking differences in the frequency of use and perceived role of SNS across the cases lead us to reason about the importance and ways of embedding open technologies with existing ICT-enabled work practices in the organisation by way of co- evolution of systems and their use.}

Existing literature theorizes that people join virtual communities to exchange information and/or social support. Theories of broader Internet use have indicated both entertainment and searching for friendship as motivational forces. This exploratory study empirically examines the importance of these reasons in assessing why people come to virtual communities by directly asking virtual community members why they joined.The responses to the open-ended question "Why did you join?" were categorized based upon the reasons suggested in the literature. Across 27 communities in 5 different broad types, 569 different reasons from 399 people indicated that most sought either friendship or exchange of information, and a markedly lower percent sought social support or recreation. The reasons were significantly dependent on the grouping of the communities into types. In all the community types information exchange was the most popular reason for joining. Thereafter, however, the reason varied depending on community type. Social support was the second most popular reason for members in communities with health/wellness and professional/occupational topics, but friendship was the second most popular reason among members in communities dealing with personal interests/hobbies, pets, or recreation. These findings suggest that virtual community managers should emphasize not only the content but also encourage the friendship and social support aspects as well if they wish to increase the success of their virtual community.},

In this article we present a study of how programmers cope with the co-existence of an industrial/commercial and a community/commons based mode of production. We analyze how they develop strategies to handle tensions that arise from contradictions between these two modes, and how it changes programmers' approach towards open source software development in the company. The study covers proprietary companies that have gradually incorporated open source software (hybrid companies) and SMEs entirely built around open source business concepts (pure-play companies). Four strategies are elaborated and discussed in-depth: Engineering in the lab, Market driven tailoring, Developing the community consortium and Peer-production. At a more general level, the study contributes to our understanding of how the transformation of proprietary production processes into a more open mode of knowledge work is not only associated with company strategies, but also with tensions and new demands on how work is strategically handled by knowledge workers.},

We focus on the template "NPOV", which signals breaches on the fundamental policy of neutrality of Wikipedia articles, and we show how and to what extent putting such template on a page affects the editing process. We notably find that intensity of editing increases immediately after the "NPOV" template appears and that controversies about articles which have received the attention of a more limited group of editors before they were tagged as controversial have a lower chance to be treated quickly.}

Using a method employed by Tankard and Royal to judge completeness of Web content, completeness of information on Wikipedia is assessed. Some topics are covered more comprehensively than others, and the predictors of these biases include recency, importance, population, and financial wealth. Wikipedia is more a socially produced document than a value-free information source. It reflects the viewpoints, interests, and emphases of the people who use it.}

We also develop and test two extensions of the earlier model: the presence of provisions mandating royalty-free licensing is negatively associated with disclosure requirements, and when there are only a limited number of SSOs, the relationship between concessions and user friendliness is weaker.},

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia's remarkable success in aggregating millions of contributions can pose a challenge for current editors, whose hard work may be reverted unless they understand and follow established norms, policies, and decisions and avoid contentious or proscribed terms. We present a machine learning model for predicting whether a contribution will be reverted based on word level features. Unlike previous models relying on editor-level characteristics, our model can make accurate predictions based only on the words a contribution changes. A key advantage of the model is that it can provide feedback on not only whether a contribution is likely to be rejected, but also the particular words that are likely to be controversial, enabling new forms of intelligent interfaces and visualizations. We examine the performance of the model across a variety of Wikipedia articles.},

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia is known as a free online encyclopedia. Wikipedia uses largely transparent writing and editing processes, which aim at providing the user with quality information through a democratic collaborative system. However, one aspect of these processes is not transparent—the identity of contributors, editors, and administrators. We argue that this particular lack of transparency jeopardizes the validity of the information being produced by Wikipedia. We analyze the social and ethical consequences of this lack of transparency in Wikipedia for all users, but especially students; we assess the corporate social performance issues involved, and we propose courses of action to compensate for the potential problems. We show that Wikipedia has the appearance, but not the reality, of responsible, transparent information production.},

  Abstract                 = {Many businesses and private households rely on Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). Due to a lack of sustained contributors, however, most FLOSS projects do not survive. The early identification of developers who are likely to remain is thus an eminent challenge for the management of FLOSS initiatives. Previous research has shown that individuals{\textquoteright} subjective assessment is often inaccurate emphasizing the need to objectively evaluate retention behavior. Consistent with the concepts Person-Job (P-J) and Person-Team (P-T) fit from the traditional recruitment literature, we derive objective measures to predict developer retention in FLOSS projects. In an analysis of the contribution behavior of former Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students we reveal that the level of development experience and conversational knowledge is strongly associated with retention. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that students with abilities that are underrepresented in the project and students with a higher academic education do not remain considerably longer.},

  Abstract                 = {It is widely accepted that wikis are valuable tools for successful collaborative knowledge building. In this paper, we describe how processes of knowledge building with wikis may be visualized, citing Wikipedia as an example. The underlying theoretical basis of our paper is the framework for collaborative knowledge building with wikis, as introduced by Cress and Kimmerle [2], [3], [4]. This model describes collaborative knowledge building as a co-evolution of individual and collective knowledge, or of cognitive and social systems respectively. These co-evolutionary processes may be visualized graphically, applying methods from social network analysis, especially those methods that take dynamic changes into account [5], [18]. For this purpose, we have undertaken to analyze, on the one hand, the temporal development of an article in the German version of Wikipedia and related articles that are linked to this core article. On the other hand, we analyzed the temporal development of those users who worked on these articles. The resulting graphics show an analogous process, both with regard to the articles that refer to the core article and to the users involved. These results provide empirical support for the co-evolution model. Some implications of our findings and the potential for future research on collaborative knowledge building with wikis and on the application of social network analysis are discussed at the end of the article. © 2008 ACM.}

In the shorter-term half of the model, it is hypothesized that once a system has gone live, two factors, namely functional fit and overcoming organizational inertia, drive organizational benefits flowing from each major ES improvement project. The importance of these factors may vary from project to project. In the long-term half of the model, it is hypothesized that four additional factors, namely integration, process optimization, improved access to information, and on-going major ES business improvement projects, drive organizational benefits from ES over the long term. Preliminary tests of the model were conducted using data from 126 customer presentations from SAP’s 2003 and 2005 Sapphire U.S. conferences. All six factors were found to be important in explaining variance in organizational benefits from enterprise systems from the perspective of senior management.}

We found a high value of clustering coefficient for the areas of Biology and Medicine, and a small value for Mathematics and Physics. The topological organization is also different for each network, including a modular structure for Biology and Medicine, a sparse structure for Mathematics and a dense core for Physics. The networks have degree distributions that can be approximated by a power-law with a cut-off. The assortativity of the isolated networks has also been investigated and the results indicate distinct patterns for each subject. We estimated the betweenness centrality of each node considering the full Wikipedia network, which contains the nodes of the four subjects and the edges between them. In addition, the average shortest path length between the subjects revealed a close relationship between the subjects of Biology and Physics, and also between Medicine and Physics. Our results indicate that the analysis of the full Wikipedia network cannot predict the behavior of the isolated categories since their properties can be very different from those observed in the full network.

Yet such undifferentiated groups are rare, if they exist at all. Here we extend an existing sociological research program to address how extant status hierarchies help organize collective actions by coordinating how much and when group members should contribute to group efforts. We outline three theoretically derived predictions of how status hierarchies organize patterns of behavior to produce larger public goods. We review existing evidence relevant to two of the three hypotheses and present results from a preliminary experimental test of the third. Findings are consistent with the model. The tendency of these dynamics to lead status-differentiated groups to produce larger public goods may help explain the ubiquity of hierarchy in groups, despite the often negative effects of status inequalities for many group members},

If the Mandarin language Wikipedia weren’t to be counted, then the Indonesian language Wikipedia would be the biggest Wikipedia, which has come from the Third World. As for the Mandarin language Wikipedia it is no surprise since Mandarin language speakers form the greatest number of speakers of any language. Furthermore many speakers of Mandarin live in the Developed World or at least in countries with adequate and widespread Internet access. Seen from that angle the achievement of the Indonesian language Wikipedia is more remarkable. The interesting question would now be how the Indonesian language Wikipedia, which is an open content (web based) encyclopaedia, can experience such a growth in the past two years. That question is the central question in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {The discussion on open innovation suggests that the ability to absorb external knowledge has become a major driver for competition. For R&D intensive large firms, the concept of open innovation in relation to absorptive capacity is relatively well understood. Little attention has; however, been paid to how both small firms and firms, which operate in traditional sectors, engage in open innovation activities. The latter two categories of firms often dispose of no, or at most a relatively low level of, absorptive capacity. Open innovation has two faces. In the case of inbound open innovation, companies screen their environment to search for technology and knowledge and do not exclusively rely on in-house R&D. A key pre-condition is that firms dispose of "absorptive capacity" to internalise external knowledge. SMEs and firms in traditional industries might need assistance in building absorptive capacity. This paper focuses on the role of collective research centres in building absorptive capacity at the inter-organisational level. In order to do so, primary data was collected through interviews with CEOs of these technology intermediaries and their member firms and analysed in combination with secondary data. The technology intermediaries discussed are created to help firms to take advantage of technological developments. The paper demonstrates that the openness of the innovation process forces firms lacking absorptive capacity to search for alternative ways to engage in inbound open innovation. The paper highlights the multiple activities of which absorptive capacity in intermediaries is made up; defines the concept of absorptive capacity as a pre-condition to open innovation; and demonstrates how firms lacking absorptive capacity collectively cope with distributed knowledge and innovation.},

Additionally, the affordances of the site support social interaction between users, thus helping individuals maintain existing relationships and deepen developing ones. We find that bonding relationships, sense of corporate citizenship, interest in connecting globally, and access to new people and expertise are all associated with greater intensity of use of the social network site.},

Two surveys conducted a year apart at a large U.S. university, complemented with in-depth interviews with 18 Facebook users, provide the study data. Intensity of Facebook use in year one strongly predicted bridging social capital outcomes in year two, even after controlling for measures of self-esteem and satisfaction with life. These latter psychological variables were also strongly associated with social capital outcomes. Self-esteem served to moderate the relationship between Facebook usage intensity and bridging social capital: those with lower self-esteem gained more from their use of Facebook in terms of bridging social capital than higher self-esteem participants. We suggest that Facebook affordances help reduce barriers that lower self-esteem students might experience in forming the kinds of large, heterogeneous networks that are sources of bridging social capital.},

  Abstract                 = {A key driver of the recent wave of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations was the assumption that the integration of business information would provide firms with a competitive advantage, yet concrete business benefits have been uneven across adopting firms. A possible explanation is that although the resource-based view holds that competitive advantage is derived from inimitable resources, ERP software has become a commodity. Socio-technical theory suggests that internal organizational resources based on a foundation of ERP technology may be the true drivers of ERP benefits. A firm's strategic configuration is posited to influence the portfolio of organizational competencies available to leverage the benefits of integrated business information, and a number of hypotheses are developed based on the notion that firms with different strategic objectives will realize different operational benefits from the adoption of ERP systems. Survey data from North American manufacturing firms that have implemented ERP systems demonstrate that ERP adopters seeking operational performance improvements are likely to realize these benefits. On the other hand, those seeking external market and supply chain performance improvements must first establish a foundation of internal operational performance improvements before customer satisfaction and supply chain benefits can be realized.},

We redress this gap by examining the central mechanisms governing the existence and resolution of collective action dilemmas in market formation. We use a computational model that centers on actor' collective development of a market infrastructure to explore the impact of different degrees of collaboration on market formation. In particular, consistent with market settings where actors tend to perform entirely distinct roles, we allow actors' resource contributions to be imperfectly substitutable. We find that while heterogeneity in growth strategies strongly reduces market emergence thresholds under perfect substitution, this effect is strongly suppressed under imperfect substitutability. Most important, our analyses point to a market emergence conundrum: market success de pends mostly on collaboration precisely where the foundation for its existence is lowest. We develop a set of propositions and a grounded typology of idealtypical instances of market formation. We discuss the implications of our findings for connecting collective action and market formation research.

  Abstract                 = {The classic problem within the information quality (IQ) research and practice community has been the problem of defining IQ. It has been found repeatedly that IQ is context sensitive and cannot be described, measured, and assured with a single model. There is a need for empirical case studies of IQ work in different systems to develop a systematic knowledge that can then inform and guide the construction of context-specific IQ models. This article analyzes the organization of IQ assurance work in a large-scale, open, collaborative encyclopedia- Wikipedia. What is special about Wikipedia as a resource is that the quality discussions and processes are strongly connected to the data itself and are accessible to the general public. This openness makes it particularly easy for researchers to study a particular kind of collaborative work that is highly distributed and that has a particularly substantial focus, not just on error detection but also on error correction. We believe that the study of those evolving debates and processes and of the IQ assurance model as a whole has useful implications for the improvement of quality in other more conventional databases.}

In this study, college students responded, in person and online, to questions about their online activities and closest friends in three contexts: social networking sites, instant messaging, and face-to-face. Results showed that participants often used the Internet, especially social networking sites, to connect and reconnect with friends and family members. Hence, there was overlap between participants' online and offline networks. However, the overlap was imperfect; the pattern suggested that emerging adults may use different online contexts to strengthen different aspects of their offline connections.

We show that recent editing activity suggests that Wikipedia growth has slowed, and perhaps plateaued, indicating that it may have come against its limits to growth. We measure growth, population shifts, and patterns of editor and administrator activities, contrasting these against past results where possible. Both the rate of page growth and editor growth has declined. As growth has declined, there are indicators of increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits. We discuss some possible explanations for these new developments in Wikipedia including decreased opportunities for sharing existing knowledge and increased bureaucratic stress on the socio-technical system itself.}

The paper seeks to focus particularly on the role of references to external sources for the stabilisation of knowledge in Wikipedia. Design/methodology/approach - The study is inspired by online ethnography. It includes 11 Wikipedia editors, together with the sociotechnical resources in Wikipedia. The material was collected through interviews, online observations, web documents and discussions, and e-mail questions. The analysis was carried out from a perspective of science and technology studies (STS). Findings - Wikipedia can be regarded as a laboratory for knowledge construction in which the already published is being recycled. The references to external sources anchor the participatory encyclopaedia in the ecology of established media and attribute trust to the knowledge published. The policy on Verifiability is analysed as an obligatory passage point to which all actors have to adjust. Active Wikipedia editors can be seen as being akin to janitors of knowledge, as they are those who, through their hands-on activities, keep Wikipedia stable. Originality/value - The study develops an innovative understanding of the knowledge construction culture in one of the most popular sources for information on the internet. By highlighting the ways in which trust is established in Wikipedia, a more reflexive use of the participatory encyclopaedia is made possible. This is of value for information literacy training.}

We analyse the structure and dynamics of these discussions in order to identify possible biases affecting their outcome. We show in particular the effects of voter heterogeneity and herding behaviour on the functioning of these collective deliberation processes.

In addition, we observe regional differences in viewing behaviors between two groups of new employees. These results suggest that a SNS can also potentially contribute to the information-seeking and sense-making activities that underlie organization acculturation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the understudied issue of how individually held expertise in information systems development (ISD) teams results in creativity at the team level during the development process. We develop the idea that team creativity results primarily from integration of individually held expertise of team members at the team level. We further propose the quality of intrateam relationships and knowledge complementarities that align the work of individual team members at the project level influence creativity primarily through the process of expertise integration. We use data from a field study of 142 participants in 42 ISD projects to test the proposed model.
The paper makes three new contributions to the IS literature. Its key contribution lies in developing an expertise integration view of team creativity. We demonstrate the centrality of integrating individually held tacit and explicit knowledge about the problem domain and the technology at the team level in achieving team creativity. The use of a process-focused conceptualization of team creativity is especially noteworthy here. The second contribution of the paper lies in conceptually developing and operationalizing the concept of expertise integration, a mechanism by which individually held knowledge is integratively applied at the project level. Although the importance of knowledge in the ISD process is widely recognized in prior research, this is the first study to develop the concept in a operationally meaningful way. The third key contribution lies in showing that the compositional and relational attributes of ISD project teams--diverse specialized knowledge in a team, the quality of intrateam working relationships, and members' cross-domain absorptive capacity--do not engender creativity by themselves; they do so primarily because they enhance integration of individual knowledge at the project level. We offer empirical evidence for such full mediation. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed in the paper.},

This network consists of four dimensions: trust, distrust, acquaintance and knowledge. Trust and distrust are based on content modifications (copying and deleting respectively), acquaintance is based on the amount of discussion on articles' talk pages between a given pair of authors and knowledge is based on the categories in which an author typically contributes. Our social network is based on the entire Wikipedia edit history, and therefore is a summary of all recorded author interactions. This social network can be used to assess the quality of a team of authors and consequently, to recommend good teams. The social network can also be used by Wikipedia authors and editors as an additional tool that allows to improve the author's collaboration, as it expresses each author's social environment and can be navigated to discover new projects that an author can participate in, or to recommend new collaborators.}},

This leads to a reassessment of the definition of a project. It is suggested that classical definitions of projects are not wrong, just incomplete. The project as a temporary organization is viewed here as a production function, as an agency for assigning resources to the management of change within the functional organization, and as an agency for managing uncertainty. The role of the project manager is also considered. The project manager is chief executive of the temporary organization, and thus their roles in objective setting and motivating team members are emphasized over their role in planning and executing work. Second, as manager of the agency, they are the agent of the owner (principal) and so a second hierarchy of management and control must be put in place to monitor their performance. These agency costs add to the cost of the project, but may also explain why professional recognition is so important
to project managers.},

Our findings show that some of the evolving topographical qualities of degree distributions, path lengths and assortativity are relatively stable with time even as collaboration patterns shift, which suggests their changes are onlyminimally associated with the ebb and flux of the success of newproductions. In contrast, the clustering coefficient changed substantially over time and we found that it had a nonlinear association with the production of financially and artistically successful shows. When the clustering coefficient ratio is lowor high, the financial and artistic success of the industry is low, while an intermediate level of clustering is associated with successful shows. We supported these findings with sociological theory on the relationship between social structure and collaboration and with tests of statistical inference. Our discussion focuses on connecting the statistical properties of social networks to their performance and the performance of the actors embedded within them.}

Employees belonging to the open source movement often advocate the use of open source software within their organization. Hence, their belief in the underlying open source software ideology may influence the decision making on the adoption of open source software. This may result in an ideological - rather than pragmatic - decision. A recent study has shown that American organizations are quite pragmatic in their adoption decision. We argue that there may be circumstances in which there is more opportunity for ideological behavior. We therefore investigated the organizational adoption decision in Belgian organizations. Our results indicate that most organizations are pragmatic in their decision making. However, we have found evidence that suggests that the influence of ideology should not be completely disregarded in small organizations. Adapted from the source document.}

  Abstract                 = {Purpose - To propose an extension to the traditional technology adoption model (TAM). Design/methodology/approach - A review of the TAM literature is presented to provide the basis for the study which identified and theorized about the general determinants of perceived usefulness (PU), subjective norm, job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability and perceived ease of use (PEOU) to produce an intermediate extension of TAM, termed TAM2, and its further development to produce what is termed TAM3. Posits three relationships that were not empirically tested by Venkatesh (2000) and Venkatesh and Davis (2000): PEOU to PU, moderated by experience; computer anxiety to PEOU, moderated by experience; and PEOU to behavioural intention, moderated by experience. Reports the results of longitudinal field studies to test TAM3, in which data was collected from four unnamed organizations implementing new IT systems. Findings - The results regarding PU were generally consistent with Venkatesh and Davis (2000), where it was found that PEOU, subjective norm, image, and result demonstrability were significant predictors of PU at all time periods, and job relevance and output quality had an interactive effect on PU such that with increasing output quality, the effect of job relevance on PU was stronger. Reports also that experience moderated the effects of subjective norm on PU such that the effect was weaker with increasing experience, while the effect of image on subjective norm was significant. Reveals also that, consistent with Venkatesh and Davis (2000), computer self-efficacy, perceptions of external control, computer anxiety, and computer playfulness were significant predictors of PEOU. Practical implications - There are important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations. Originality/value - Presents an important first step in understanding the role of interventions in IT adoption contexts.

  Abstract                 = {{The name "Wikipedia" has been associated with terms such as collaboration, volunteers, reliability, vandalism, and edit-war. Fewer people might think of "images," "maps," "diagrams," "illustrations" in this context. This paper presents the burgeoning but underexplored visual side of the online encyclopedia. A survey conducted with image contributors to Wikipedia reveals key differences in collaborating around images as opposed to text. The results suggest that, even though image editing is a more isolated activity, somewhat shielded from vandalism, the sense of community is an important motivation for image contributors. By examining how contributors are appropriating text-oriented wiki technology to support collective editing around visual materials, this paper reveals the potential and some of the limitations of wikis in the realm of visual collaboration.}}

Possibilities of research are explored including examples and first results. Several characteristics that are found in Wikipedia, such as exponential growth and scale-free networks are already known in other context. However the Wiki architecture also possesses some intrinsic specialities. General trends are measured that are typical for all Wikipedias but vary between languages in detail.}

Moreover, design and coaching interact, so that well-designed teams are helped more by effective coaching—and undermined less by ineffective coaching—than are poorly designed teams.}

OSS has existed as a model for developing computer applications and software since the 1950s. However, OSS has only found its way into the public arena within the past decade due to some major projects gaining significant market share from commercial developers such as Microsoft. Research in the area of OSS has become more extensive in recent years and has examined areas such as motivation of programmers as well as the benefits of OSS. However, literature focusing on the actual implementation of OSS is more limited with only Fitzgerald and Kenny (2004). Developing an information infrastructure with Open Source Software. IEEE Software, 50-55 providing any substantial analysis of how it might be achieved. In this paper the focus is on OSS use and implementation within the UK public sector. This sector has a history of resource wastage and underperforming information systems. The underpinning issues of motivation and benefits to organisations will be addressed along with the difficulties that the UK Government faces in adopting an OSS strategy. Section 2 examines the existing literature in the area and explores why OSS should be adopted and implemented by the public sector in the UK. Section 3 considers the research approach taken and the results obtained from considering the implementation of OSS in eight government organisations. Section 4 concludes with a discussion and some implications for those organisations in the public sector who might wish to take this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic networks of practice are computer-mediated discussion forums focused on problems of practice that enable individuals to exchange advice and ideas with others based on common interests. However, why individuals help strangers in these electronic networks is not well understood: there is no immediate benefit to the contributor, and free-riders are able to acquire the same knowledge as everyone else. To understand this paradox, we apply theories of collective action to examine how individual motivations and social capital influence knowledge contribution in electronic networks. This study reports on the activities of one electronic network supporting a professional legal association. Using archival, network, survey, and content analysis data, we empirically test a model of knowledge contribution. We find that people contribute their knowledge when they perceive that it enhances their professional reputations, when they have the experience to share, and when they are structurally embedded in the network. Surprisingly, contributions occur without regard to expectations of reciprocity from others or high levels of commitment to the network.},

Further results are that (i) the provision of perks may actually hurt the agent, even though perks per se are enjoyable for him, (ii) the principal may prefer an organizational structure with high costs of monitoring, and (iii) when there are several types of perks, the principal may choose other perks than the social planner would choose},

This accessibility is frequently abused (e.g., vandalism and spam). However, certain inappropriate behaviors are more threatening than others. In this work, we study contributions which are not simply "undone" -- but deleted from revision histories and public view. Such treatment is generally reserved for edits which: (1) present a legal liability to the host (e.g., copyright issues, defamation), or (2) present privacy threats to individuals (i.e., contact information). Herein, we analyze one year of Wikipedia's public deletion log and use brute-force strategies to learn about privately handled redactions. This permits insight about the prevalence of deletion, the reasons that induce it, and the extent of end-user exposure to dangerous content. While Wikipedia's approach is generally quite reactive, we find that copyright issues prove most problematic of those behaviors studied.}

  Abstract                 = {Market selection of product compatibility standards has long been explained through aggregate positive-feedback theoretical models of economic utility. Explaining aggregate patterns of organizational standards adoption requires two additional steps — not only differences between organizations, but also differences within organizations. Here we present a qualitative study of how organizations do (or do not) adopt a new computer server platform standard, namely Linux using PC-compatible hardware. While discussions of Linux typically focus on its open source origins, our respondents were primarily interested in low price. Despite this relative advantage in price, incumbent standards enjoyed other advantages identified by prior theory, namely network effects and switching costs. We show when, how and why such incumbent advantages are overcome by a new standard. We find that Linux adoption within organizations began for uses with a comparatively limited scope of deployment, thus minimizing network effect and switching costs disadvantages. We identify four attributes of information systems that potentially limit the scope of deployment: few links of the system to organizational processes, special-purpose computer systems, new uses and replacement of obsolete systems. We also identify an organizational level variable — internal standardization — which increases scope of deployment and thus the attractiveness of the incumbent standard.

  Abstract                 = {To attract complementary assets, firms that sponsor proprietary de facto compatibility standards must trade off control of the standard against the imperative for adoption. For example, Microsoft and Intel in turn gained pervasive adoption of their technologies by appropriating only a single layer of the standards architecture and encouraging competition in other layers. In reaction to such proprietary strategies, the open source movement relinquished control to maximize adoption. To illustrate this, we examine the rise of the Linux operating system from 1995-2001, particularly the motivations of organizational buyers and suppliers of complementary assets, and Microsoft’s reaction to its success.

Regression analysis suggests that employee behavior on social network sites (SNSs) reveals information about both professional and personal closeness. While some factors are predictive of general closeness (e.g. content recommendations), other factors signal that employees feel personal closeness towards their colleagues, but not professional closeness (e.g. mutual profile commenting). This analysis contributes to our understanding of how SNS behavior reflects relationship multiplexity: the multiple facets of our relationships with SNS connections.},

The knowledge in Wikipedia is produced and processed collaboratively by UIC. The results of this collaboration process present various seemingly complex patterns demonstrated by update history of different articles in Wikipedia. Agent simulation is a powerful method that is used to study the behaviors of complex systems of interacting and autonomous agents. In this paper, we study the collaborative knowledge processing in Wikipedia using a simple agent-based model. The proposed model considers factors including knowledge distribution among agents, number of agents, behavior of agents and vandalism. We use this model to explain content growth rate, number and frequency of updates, edit war and vandalism in Wikipedia articles. The results demonstrate that the model captures the important empirical aspects in collaborative knowledge processing in Wikipedia.}

Of the many websites with user-generated content on the Internet, one of the most renowned is Wikipedia, which is the largest multilingual free-content encyclopedia written by users collaboratively. Nevertheless, although contributing to Wikipedia takes time and knowledge, contributors are rarely compensated. As a result, there is a need to understand why individuals share their knowledge in Wikipedia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of both conventional and self concept-based motivation on individual willingness to share knowledge in Wikipedia. After performing an online questionnaire survey, SEM was applied to assess the proposed model and hypotheses. The analytical results showed that internal self-concept motivation is the key motivation for knowledge sharing on Wikipedia.},

A survey was administered after a 2-week trial period and the actual use of the system was recorded by the Blackboard system over 8 weeks.

Specially, we found that highly involved contributors were more likely to adopt SuggestBot; interpersonal exposure to innovation, cohesion, and tie homophily all substantially increased the likelihood of adoption. However, connections to prominent, high-status contributors did not influence adoption. Finally, although the SuggestBot innovation saw limited distribution, adopters made significantly more contributions to Wikipedia after adoption than nonadopter counterparts in the comparison group.},

We attribute the cause to social effects: contributors receive social benefits that increase with both the amount of their contributions and group size, and the shrinking group size weakens these social benefits. Consistent with our explanation, we find that the more contributors value social benefits, the more they reduce their contributions after the block.}

Not surprisingly, its huge success has in turn led to immense research interest for a better understanding of the collaborative knowledge building process. In this paper, we performed a (terrorism) domain-specific case study, comparing and contrasting the knowledge evolution in Wikipedia with a knowledge base created by domain experts. Specifically, we used the Terrorism Knowledge Base (TKB) developed by experts at MIPT. We identified 409 Wikipedia articles matching TKB records, and went ahead to study them from three aspects: creation, revision, and link evolution. We found that the knowledge building in Wikipedia had largely been independent, and did not follow TKB - despite the open and online availability of the latter, as well as awareness of at least some of the Wikipedia contributors about the TKB source. In an attempt to identify possible reasons, we conducted a detailed analysis of contribution behavior demonstrated by Wikipedians. It was found that most Wikipedians contribute to a relatively small set of articles each. Their contribution was biased towards one or very few article(s). At the same time, each article's contributions are often championed by very few active contributors including the article's creator. We finally arrive at a conjecture that the contributions in Wikipedia are more to cover knowledge at the article level rather than at the domain level.}

Although every member can exhibit some leadership behavior, different types of leadership behavior performed by different types of leaders may not be equally effective. This paper investigates how distinct types of leadership behaviors (transactional, aversive, directive and person-focused) and the legitimacy of the people who deliver them (people in formal leadership positions or not) influence the contributions that other participants make in the context of Wikipedia. After using propensity score matching to control for potential pre-existing differences among those who were and were not targets of leadership behaviors, we found that 1) leadership behaviors performed by members at all levels significantly influenced other members' motivation; 2) transactional leadership and person-focused leadership were effective in motivating others to contribute more, whereas aversive leadership decreased other contributors' motivations; and 3) legitimate leaders were in general more influential than regular peer leaders.

  Abstract                 = {The article discusses the management of virtual teams. Virtual teams come in many flavors, and "virtuality" as a characteristic can be defined on many dimensions. Rather than thinking of a team as either virtual or not, it makes sense to think of a team as existing on a continuum of virtuality. The more dimensions or aspects on which the team is dispersed, the more virtual it is. The article shows different dimensions of virtuality as a circle, so there is no implication of a rank order on any of the dimensions. Many more dimensions could be included, but these are the most common ones that people think of when they think of virtual teams. The expanding circle also indicates that the more virtual a team becomes, the more complex are the issues it must address to function effectively. At the center is the traditional way teams have worked together, while going out from the center, one enters new territory. For purposes of this article, and consistent with an early and popular view on virtual teams, one defines a virtual team as a collection of individuals who are geographically and/or organizationally or otherwise dispersed and who collaborate via communication and information technologies in order to accomplish a specific goal.},

  Abstract                 = {Wikipedia is a popular web-based encyclopedia edited freely and collaboratively by its users. In this paper we present an analysis of Wikipedias in several languages as complex networks. The hyperlinks pointing from one Wikipedia article to another are treated as directed links while the articles represent the nodes of the network. We show that many network characteristics are common to different language versions of Wikipedia, such as their degree distributions, growth, topology, reciprocity, clustering, assortativity, path lengths, and triad significance profiles. These regularities, found in the ensemble of Wikipedias in different languages and of different sizes, point to the existence of a unique growth process. We also compare Wikipedias to other previously studied networks.},

  Abstract                 = {We show how reciprocal arcs significantly influence the structural organization of Wikipedias, online encyclopedias. It is shown that random addition of reciprocal arcs in the static network cannot explain the observed reciprocity of Wikipedias. A model of Wikipedia growth based on preferential attachment and on information exchange via reciprocal arcs is presented. An excellent agreement between in-degree distributions of our model and real Wikipedia networks is achieved without fitting the distributions, but by merely extracting a small number of model parameters from the measurement of real networks.}

  Abstract                 = {One of the biggest challenges faced by social media sites like Wikipedia is how to motivate users to contribute content. Research continues to demonstrate that only a small percentage of users contribute to user-generated content sites. In this study we assess the results of a Wikimedia Foundation initiative, which had graduate and undergraduate students from 22 U.S. universities contribute content to Wikipedia articles as part of their coursework. 185 students were asked about their participation in the initiative and their intention to participate on Wikipedia in the future. Results suggest that intentions to continue contributing are influenced by the initial attitude towards the class, and the degree to which students perceived they were writing for a global audience.},

  Abstract                 = {{The Oxford Handbook of Corporate Social Responsibility is a review of the academic research that has both prompted, and responded to, the issues of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Business schools, the media, the corporate sector, governments, and non-governmental organizations have all begun to pay more attention to these issues in recent years. These issues encompass broad questions about the changing relationship between business, society and government, environmental issues, corporate governance, the social and ethical dimensions of management, globalization, stakeholder debates, shareholder and consumer activism, changing political systems and values, and the ways in which corporations can respond to new social imperatives. The book, which provides clear thinking and new perspectives on CSR and the debates around it, is divided into seven key sections: introduction; perspectives on CSR; critiques of CSR; actors and drivers; managing CSR; CSR in a global context; future perspectives and conclusions.}}

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer contributors to help this project come to fruition.
first of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
<h1> What is this project about?</h1>

First of all, this review of the litterature is not about any article written refering to Wikipedia.

In terms of scope, it is about how Wikipedia works, what it produces. Proposition of new tools, or the use of Wikipedia as a use case for datamining, textmining, for instance is clearly out of the scope.

Secondly, the articles referenced in the review have to have been presented to a conference, a journal, or, at least, reviewed in the Wikimedia's monthly research newsletter.

<h1>Explanation of the Structure of the document.</h1>

I've tried to make this document as modular as possible, based on the different categories proposed by Hess and Ostrom in their knowledge common framework (see the .pdf file too).

This framework is detailled bellow in the case of Wikipedia (adaptation of the Model of group processes in open content communities, from Carillo and Okoli (2011), figure 1 page 210, improved in the outcomes, and the retro-action, mainly).

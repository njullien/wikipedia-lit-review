first of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

How to contribute

First of all, this review of the litterature is not about any article written refering to Wikipedia.
In terms of scope, it is about how Wikipedia works, what it produces. Proposition of new tools, or the use of Wikipedia as a use case for datamining, textmining, for instance is clearly out of the scope.
Secondly, the articles referenced in the review have to have been presented to a conference, a journal, or, at least, reviewed in the Wikimedia's monthly research newsletter.


I've tried to make this document as modular as possible, based on the different categories proposed by Hess and Ostrom in their knowledge common framework.


Please send a GitHub Pull Request to wikipedia-lit-review with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request,
write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact, especially if a reference has been added."


Thanks, Nicolas Jullien
